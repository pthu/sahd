## Introduction

Grammatical Type: n.m.(?)  
Occurrences: 2x HB (0/0/2); 0x Sir; 0x Qum; 0x inscr. (Total: 2).

* Ketubim: Job 30:24; 36:19.
* Text doubtful: –


<b>A.1</b>  The whole of the verse Job 30:24 is obscure and many emendations have been proposed in the past. However, if  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> is understood to
denote the ‘cry’ of the poor (e.g., Dhorme 1967; Habel 1985:416), it echoes 29:12, where the verb  <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span> occurs.


<b>A.2</b>  Job 36:19 is also a difficult verse, the sense of <span dir="rtl">לֹא בְצָר</span> (or at least its grammatical connection) being particularly elusive. But the reading  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעֲךָ</span> is generally retained and its presence can be detected behind all the (very varied) versional renderings of the verse (see
below).

Qere/Ketiv: none.

## 1. Root and Comparative Material


<b>A.1</b>  See also 
<a href="/sahd/words/great_man/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>, especially on the PNN, for which the occurrences of  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> provide a more plausible basis for the use as an element of a PN.

<span id="RCMA2"> 
<b>A.2</b></span>
  Although this noun might be derived from a biliteral by-form of the verb  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, ‘to save’, it could equally be cognate with  <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span> <i>piel</i>, ‘to cry out for help’. BDB (447; 1002) lists it under both roots to indicate uncertainty on the matter, but expresses preference for the second option (447), and this fits the context where it is used better.

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  Probably of the <i>qutl</i> pattern (BL, 461 §61.l’’), if it is derived from the triliteral root  <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span> (see above <a href="#RCMA2">Root and Comparative Material A.2</a>).[^1] 
Such a derivation is favoured by Wildberger (1978:807, 818) for <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> in Isa 22:5, in preference to the alternative view that it means the Sutu (as in Ezek 23:23), which would require the emendation of  <span dir="rtl">קִר</span> in the previous stich to  <span dir="rtl">קוֹעַ</span>. If  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> is related to the verb <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span>, the loss of the consonantal <i>waw</i> may be due to the preceding <i>u</i> vowel (Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §26b). This does not occur with the noun  <span dir="rtl">שַׁעֲוָה</span>, ‘a cry for help’,
perhaps to distinguish it from  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> (cf. Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §26c, n. 2), but more likely because there is no original <i>u</i> vowel in that word, which is of the <i>qitlat</i> pattern.


## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b>   <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> is the subject (or perhaps object) of the verb  <span dir="rtl">עָרַךְ</span>, ‘to arrange’ (Job 36:19).

<b>A.2</b>   <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> is (in MT: see further below <a href="#ExA1">Exegesis A.1</a>) subject of a nominal clause with  <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> + 3fem.(!)pl. suffix and  <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> +  <span dir="rtl">פִּידוֹ</span> (Job 30:24). It is less likely that it is preceded by  <span dir="rtl">לָהֶן</span>, ‘therefore’: this occurs mainly in Aramaic (though 2x in the book of Ruth, where it is spelt <span dir="rtl">לָהֵן</span>) and does not fit the context here.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>: 

* δέομαι?, ‘to pray’: Job 30:24; 
* δέησις, ‘entreaty’: Job 36:19.

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>: 

* <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩ</span> (<i>prq</i>), ‘to save, liberate’: Job 30:24; 36:19.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: K)</b>:  

* <span dir="rtl">צלות</span>, ‘prayer’: Job 30:24;  
* <span dir="rtl">בעות</span>, ‘request’: 36:19.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>: 

* <i>salvo</i>, ‘to save’: Job 30:24; 
* <i>magnitudo</i>, ‘greatness’: Job 36:19.


<b>A.1</b>  Apart from LXX, the Versions in both places attempt a word-by-word rendering of a <i>Vorlage</i> that was similar or identical to MT, even if the translators were (understandably) unable to produce a coherent translation of the verses as a whole which fitted well into their respective contexts. It is therefore possible to deduce with some certainty what they took  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> to mean, though three different
interpretations of it are attested.

<b>A.2</b>  Pesh associated  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> with  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, for which its rendering <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩ</span> (<i>prq</i>) is often used. Tg’s two equivalents, meaning ‘prayer’ (Job 30:24) and ‘request’ (Job 36:19), evidently had a word related to the verb <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span>, ‘cry out’, in mind. Vg gives two different interpretations, agreeing with Pesh in Job 30:24 but offering an abstract noun meaning ‘greatness’
in Job 36:19. The latter will be related to Vg’s rendering of <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> in Isa 32:5 (<i>maior</i>) and implies that the Heb. consonants were read by it as <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> here too.

<b>B.1</b>  LXX’s renderings of both verses are (typically for the translation of Job) free and imprecise (cf. Driver and Gray 1921, 2:280 on 36:19). They seem to be improvisations based mainly on the (preceding) context and matches with words in MT are by no means certain. But it is probably significant that δεηθείς in Job 30:24 and δεήσεως in 36:19 (just before
ἐν ἀνάγκῃ) occur in approximately the places where renderings of  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> would be expected. If so, LXX understood  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> in the same way as Tg was later to do.

<b>A.1</b>  [nil]

## 6. Exegesis


<span id="ExA1"> 
<b>A.1</b></span> Job 30:24 belongs to Job’s <i>apologia</i> (ch. 29-31) in which he presents himself as an impeccably kind and righteous man. He particularly emphasises his generosity to the poor (29:12-17; 31:13-22). The MT of 30:24 as it stands is ‘unintelligible’ (Driver and Gray 1921, 1:259)
and does not include any word for a poor man, but there is one in the following verse. The varied emendations and interpretations proposed show that there can be no certainty here (cf. ibid. 2:219). But the suffix of  <span dir="rtl">בְּפִידוֹ</span> needs an antecedent and there is none in the present wording of the earlier part of the verse. The best solution (better than the popular  <span dir="rtl">טֹבֵעַ</span>) is to read <span dir="rtl">בְעָנִי</span>, ‘against an afflicted man’, for
the unlikely <span dir="rtl">בְעִי</span>.[^2] The fem.pl.
suffix of <span dir="rtl">לָהֶן</span> can hardly be right, but in the palaeo-Hebrew script <i>mem</i> and <i>nun</i> could easily be confused. A form with a pl. suffix
(<span dir="rtl">לָהֶם</span>) is unlikely: by itself <span dir="rtl">עָנִי</span> could be taken collectively, but  <span dir="rtl">בְּפִידוֹ</span> shows that it means a (typical) single individual. Habel (1985:417) follows Dhorme (1967) and more dubiously the free translation of LXX in reading <span dir="rtl">לִי</span>, which gives the literal translation ‘when in his distress there is a cry to me’, on the basis that <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> here is related to <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span>, as most commentators have thought. Perhaps better, and closer to MT, we propose to read  <span dir="rtl">לִמְשַׁוֵּעַ</span> for the last two words and translate ‘or in his distress to the one who cries out’, understanding the verb from the
first half of the verse, with a variation in the preposition used after it. MT could have arisen on this view from a mistake in the word-division, leading to the change of  <span dir="rtl">לָם</span> to the more regular  <span dir="rtl">לָהֶם</span>, followed by the confusion of <i>mem</i> and <i>nun</i> posited above. The correctness of one of these solutions receives some support from 29:12, where  <span dir="rtl">עָנִי</span> and <span dir="rtl">מְשַׁוֵּעַ</span> occur adjacent to one another.

<b>A.2</b>  In his third and fourth speeches (36:1-37:26) Elihu turns from argument to a direct address to Job, in which rebuke and instruction are
combined. In 36:17-23 he warns Job that his arrogance may be the ruin of him. In this context a reference to his ‘cry’ (<span dir="rtl">שׁוּעֲךָ</span>) in 36:19 fits
well, because Elihu has already specifically said that God does not answer the prayers of the arrogant (35:12-13). In parallel he speaks here of <span dir="rtl">כֹּל מַאֲמַצֵּי־כֹחַ</span>, ‘all the powers of strength’, which might be Job’s pretended ability to argue with God as an equal, as being equally futile. The words <span dir="rtl">לֹא בְצָר</span>, ‘not in distress’, remain puzzling: they apparently represent the expected effect of <span dir="rtl">יַעֲרֹךְ</span>; but since the
meaning (or even the reading) of that word is far from certain it is impossible to explain exactly how <span dir="rtl">לֹא בְצָר</span> might express ‘removal from
distress’. In fact Driver and Gray (1921, 2:279) reasonably argue that ‘<span dir="rtl">לא בצר</span> is not the same as <span dir="rtl">בלא צר</span> (8:11; 30:28), but can only mean <i>without affliction</i> (cf. 4:21; 34:20)’. On this basis Dillmann’s rendering of
the verse, which they cite (280), ‘Can he (God) bring thy cry into order (i.e. make it a cry of submission) without (the use of) affliction, and all the efforts of his strength’, has much to be said for it. But the
association of <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> with <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span> remains plausible however this problem is (or is not) solved. The alternative ‘riches’ (Driver and Gray 1921, 1:313; 2:279) or ‘opulence’ (Pope 1973:267) has no real foundation.


<span id="Con"></span>
## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>  In view of the problems in both verses where  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> occurs, certainty about its meaning is impossible. But it is most likely that it is
related, as is more generally (but not universally) accepted for <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> in Isa 22:5, to  <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span>, ‘cry out’. The Versions (LXX, Tg) provide some support for this view. It has, in other words, nothing to do with <span dir="rtl">יָשַׁע</span> and the ‘deliverance’ word-group more generally (<i>pace</i> Pesh and [in Job 30:24] Vg).
