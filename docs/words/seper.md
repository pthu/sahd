## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  

<i>Egyptian</i>:The Semitic loanword <i>sōpēr</i>,  ‘scribe’, is attested in literature of the New Kingdom as <i>šu-pi-r(a)</i> (Hoch, <i>SWET</i>, 364).





<i>Akkadian</i>: <i>sipru</i>  ‘document in Aramaic’; <i>sepēru</i>,  ‘to write alphabetic script’; <i>sepīru</i>  ‘scribe writing alphabetic script (mostly on skin) (<i>CAD</i> (S), 225,  304; <i>AEAD</i>, 99-100) are late loans from Aramaic. 


A relation with genuine Akkadian <i>šapāru</i>, ‘to send’, but also  ‘to send word, to send a report, a message, to write’ (<i>CAD</i> [Š] 1, 430-448; <i>AHw</i>, 1170-1) and its derivatives, among them <i>šiprētu</i>,  ‘sealed document’, and <i>šipru</i>,  ‘report, message’, is likely, despite the irregular correspondence between the sibilants (<i>AHw</i>, 1170; <i>HALAT</i>, 723; <i>HAHAT</i>, 898-900; Klein, <i>CEDHL</i>, 455; Tawil, <i>ALCBH</i>, 266). In Akkadian the semantic notion of writing was taken over by <i>šaṭāru</i>,  ‘to write’, and its derivatives, e.g., the nouns <i>šaṭāru</i>,  ‘copy, exemplar, text, inscription, writing’, <i>šiṭirtu</i>,  ‘inscription, text’, <i>šiṭru</i>,  ‘text, document, inscription’; cf. <i>CAD</i> (Š) 2, 221-41; (Š) 3, 144-7.


It is possible that Ugaritic and other Canaanite dialects received the Akkadian <i>šapāru</i> and <i>šipru</i> via Assyrian or Hittite which both pronounced <i>š</i> as <i>s</i>. See, however, the counter-position taken by Muffs 1969, 207 and Mankowski, <i>ALBH</i>, 121-3.





<i>Ugaritic</i>: <i>spr</i> has many different meanings, among them  ‘register, list, written document, letter’ (Del Olmo Lete & Sanmartín, <i>DULAT</i>, 767-9).



<i>Phoenician, Punic</i>: <i>spr</i>, ‘inscription’ (Hoftijzer & Jongeling, <i>DNSI</i>, 799-801; Krahmalkov, <i>PPD</i>, 347).



<i>Old and Imperial Aramaic</i>: <i>sprʾ</i> has many different meanings, among them  ‘writing, inscription, document, contract, letter’ (Hoftijzer & Jongeling, <i>DNSI</i>, 799-801;
Porten & Lund, <i>ADE</i>, 243). Also a literary text like the Book of Balaam, son of Beor, written in ink on the whitewashed wall of a sanctuary in Sukkoth (Deir ʿAlla), was called a <i>spr</i> (Aḥituv, <i>EFP</i>, 435).



<i>Postbiblical Hebrew</i>: <i>spr</i> in many different meanings, e.g.,  ‘written document, book, letter’, but especially  ‘Bible, Scripture’ (Levy, <i>WTM</i>, Bd. 3, 576-7).



<i>Jewish Aramaic</i>: <i>sprʾ</i>,  ‘book, Bible’ (Sokoloff, <i>DJPA</i>. 387).



<i>Samaritan Aramaic</i>: <i>spr</i>,  ‘book, document’ (Tal, <i>DSA</i>, 607).





<i>Syriac</i>: <i>sefrā</i>,  ‘writing, book, letter, language’ (Payne Smith [Margoliouth], <i>CSD</i>, 387).



<i>Mandaic</i>: <i>ʾaspar</i>, <i>sipra</i>,  ‘book’ (Macuch, <i>MD</i>, 29, 329).



<i>Old Arabic</i>:Sabaean <i>sfrt</i>,  ‘measure’ (Biella, <i>DOSA</i>, 342).



<i>Classical Arabic</i>: <i>sifr</i>,  ‘book, writing’ (Lane, <i>AEL</i>, 1371), is probably an Aramaic loanword. Genuine Arabic cognates might be <i>sabara</i> and <i>šabara</i>,  ‘to measure’ (Lane, <i>AEL</i>, 1293, 1495).



<i>Modern Arabic</i>:Mehri <i>ś<sup>e</sup>būr</i>,  ‘to measure’, <i>śēb<sup>e</sup>r</i>,  ‘span of outspread fingers’. Palestinian Arabic <i>sēfer</i>,  ‘book’, is no doubt a loanword (Barthélemy, 344).


<i>Ethiopic</i>:Geez <i>safara</i>,  ‘to measure’, <i>sefrat</i>,  ‘measure’, <i>masfart</i>,  ‘length’ (Leslau, <i>ESAC</i>, 488-9).
Amharic <i>säfärä</i>,  ‘measure’ (Leslau, <i>CAmhD</i>, 60).

## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Textual Evidence


<b>A.1</b>
Although <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> can designate any written sheet or collection of sheets in Biblical Hebrew, in most 
cases <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> means  ‘book’. For instance, in Eccl. 12:12: <span dir="rtl">קֵצּ</span> <span dir="rtl">אֵין</span> <span dir="rtl">הַרְבֵּה</span> <span dir="rtl">סְפָרִים</span> <span dir="rtl">עֲשֹׂות</span>,  ‘of making many books there is no end’. Especially, <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> occurs in book-titles, for instance: <span dir="rtl">יְהוָה</span> <span dir="rtl">מִלְחֲמֹת</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>, ‘the Book of the Wars of YHWH’ (Num. 21:14),
<span dir="rtl">מֹשֶׁה</span> <span dir="rtl">תֹֹּורַת</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>,  ‘the Book of the Torah of Moses’ (Josh. 8:31; 23:6), <span dir="rtl">הַיָּשָׁר</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>, ‘the Book of the Just’ (Josh. 
10:13; 2 Sam 1:18), <span dir="rtl">שְׁלֹמֹה</span> <span dir="rtl">דִּבְרֵי</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>, ‘the Book of the Acts of Solomon’ (1 Kgs 11:41), etc.


The physical object can be designated by <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>  (see e.g. Exod 17:24; 32:32-33) but more 
specifically by the combination <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת־סֵפֶר</span> or <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>  alone (→ <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>). 

However, it is not always certain that a <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> was an object of papyrus or leather/parchment. In Ugaritic <i>spr</i> may designate a clay tablet and in Phoenician and Old Aramaic an inscription in or on  a durable kind of stone like basalt (see section 4). There is no reason at all to suppose that in al these cases the text was copied from a scroll (<i>pace</i> Vander Toorn 2007, 176). In Isa 30:8 <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> is used in parallelism with → <span dir="rtl">לוּחַ</span>,  ‘tablet’  and the explicit addition that it had to serve  ‘as a witness for ever’ suggests that this <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> at least was made of  durable stone. Obviously this recalls the <span dir="rtl">הָאֶבֶן</span> <span dir="rtl">לֻחֹת</span>,  ‘tablets of stone’, given to Moses according to Exod 24:12 (cf. Liedke 1971, 156-7; Korpel 1990, 471-3). In Deut 31:26 the additional teachings incorporated in the Law are designated <span dir="rtl">הַתֹֹּורָה</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>,  ‘Book of the Law’ and are put beside the Ark containing the tablets of the Decalogue. Because in this case too it is added that this  <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> shall be  ‘a witness for ever’, the suggestion is created that the writing material was able to stand te tooth of time. Nothing in the text suggests that it was a scroll protected by a container, as some scholars have suggested.

A less frequent but also important meaning of 
<span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> is  ‘letter’ (cf. e.g. 2 Sam 11:14-15; 1 Kgs 21:8-9, 11; Jer 29:1). Letters were 
written (√<span dir="rtl">כתב</span>), sealed (√<span dir="rtl">חתם</span>, → <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם</span>), and sent (√<span dir="rtl">שׁלח</span>) (cf. 1 Kgs 21:9).


Another meaning of <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> is  ‘written document’ in a legal context, for instance:
a  ‘letter of divorce’, <span dir="rtl">כְּרִיתֻת</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>  (Deut 24:1, 3; Isa 50:1; Jer 3:8). 
or an  ‘evidence of purchase’, <span dir="rtl">הַמִּקְנָה</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>  (Jer 32:11, 12, 14, 16). In the latter case, a 
distinction is made between the sealed part of 
the letter (<span dir="rtl">הֶחָתוּם</span>) (vv. 11, 14) and the open letter (<span dir="rtl">הַגָּלוּי</span> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>, v. 14).

In Late Biblical Hebrew <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> can mean  ‘decree’ (Est. 1:22; 3:13 etc.). 


A special case is <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> in Num. 5:23: in the case of assumed adultery the priest should write 
curses on a <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> and blot them out with bitter water. In this case the word indicates a sheet or scroll of 
papyrus. 
However, in Dan. 1:4, 17 <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> designates a kind of writing (Chaldaean alphabet) and in Isa 
29:11-12  ‘writing’ in general.



In Isa 29:11-12 an incomprehensible vision is 
compared with a sealed <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>  (here probably a letter) which nobody can read.
In Isa 34:4 it is predicted that the heavens 
will be rolled together as a <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>. Here a scroll is meant probably .

The word occurs in many texts from the period of early Judaism on, cf. Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1017-8; <i>DCH</i>, vol. 6, 189-93.

### 6.3 Archaeology

<b>A.1</b> 
Because of the unfavourable climatic conditions 
in Israel most writings on papyrus and leather 
have been lost due to climatic circumstances. Thus far only one Hebrew papyrus from the preexilic period has been recovered (Aḥituv, <i>EFP</i>, 213-5) although papyrus must have been the most common writing material. Even Byblos which lended its name to βίβλος harvested papyrus from Lake Hule in what is now Israelite territory. Only in the dry climate of the Judean Desert have parchment and papyrus survived, hidden in jars and caves. Writings on stone and shards had a better chance to be preserved. It is sometimes stated that scrolls of leather or parchment were used from the second century BCE onwards only (cf. Smelik 1990), but this is not entirely certain anymore (→ <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>).




## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
In distinction to → <span dir="rtl">לוּחַ</span>, ‘board, tablet’,  the biblical word <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> was mostly used for documents written on less durable materials (papyrus or parchment). However, the older cognates as well as a few passages in the Hebrew Bible prove that it cannot be excluded that in an earlier period a  <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> might also have been written on clay tablets or even on natural stone.  

The semantic sphere of <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> must have been rather broad, the basic meaning being apparently  ‘written text’. In Biblical Hebrew texts possible translations are   ‘book’,  ‘letter’,  ‘record’,  ‘document’.  <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> can also be used in the title of a book.For documents consisting of several sheets of 
papyrus/parchment glued/sewed together there was a 
special designation, <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת־סֵפֶר</span>, or merely  → <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>).
