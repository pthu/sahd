##Art and Archaeology

<b>A.1</b> There are many representations of royal and divine figures wearing headdresses marking their high status, but it is hard to say what exactly could be considered an <span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span> by a writer in Ancient Hebrew. Roughly contemporaneous with the biblical period in Israel are the pictures of Assyrian royal headdresses (<i>ANEP</i> 441-54),
Aramaean regal caps (<i>ANEP</i> 455, 460),
Persian crowns (<i>ANEP</i> 462), and there are many depictions from the same period of Syrian, Assyrian and Babylonian gods and goddesses in special headgear
(<i>ANEP</i> 529, 531-36, 538). This is in sharp contrast to the absence of literary references to any sort of crown for Yahweh, except for the <span dir="rtl">עֲטֶרֶת תִּפְאֶרֶת</span> held in his hand (Isa 62:3).

<b>A.2</b> Several Ammonite plaques and busts depicting heads wearing crowns have been found. They date from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron II Period, and usually have the Egyptian Atef crown, the white crown of upper Egypt with ostrich plumes on each side or a reed crown bound at the top and flanked by ostrich feathers. A clay plaque found near Amman is identified by Abou Assaf (1980:76-79, 85) as the deity Milkom, partly on the basis of 
2 Sam 12:30/1 Chron 20:2. Younker (1989:378) equates Milkom with Baʿal Hammon and Canaanite El, and onomastic data (Israel 1990:333-34; Herr 1989:369-70; 1992:187-200) have led Daviau and Dion (1994:164) to argue that it was El who was the god of the Ammonites, that Milkom may have been an epithet for him as head of the pantheon, and that the Amman plaque of a crowned deity depicts El.

The band that holds the hair together is fastened crosswise at the back of the head
(Zayadine 1974: plate III; Abou Assaf 1980:25, 36, 91).
 

##Conclusion

    
<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span> is not an unequivocal emblem of monarchy, given that it is worn not only by the king but by commoners and women, unlike
<span dir="rtl">נֵזֶר</span>.
Even a gold <span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span> is not restricted to the king or royal family, since both Mordecai and Joshua are given them, though in these contexts significant honour must be indicated. Ezek 21:31, where the word is coupled with
<span dir="rtl">מִצְנֶפֶת</span>, does not seem to point to <span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span> being a sign of kingship, but even that passage seems to have more to do with utter humiliation than with loss of kingship <i>per se</i>.
 
<b>A.2</b> Altogether, the word is used in non-royal contexts more frequently than royal, especially to indicate ceremony and/or rejoicing.
In Song 3:11 it is likely that the
<span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span>, with which Solomon was crowned by his mother, was part of his marriage celebrations, not part of royal insignia.
<span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span> is a symbol of distinction or rejoicing, but not connected with the cult of Yahweh, though it may be a feature of an Ammonite idol.
 
<b>A.3</b> An <span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span> can be made of flowers if a wreath, or of precious metal if a crown, and can contain gems. It has many similarities with the Greek word στέφανος, which also means a crown or a wreath, and connotes victory and celebration.
 
<b>A.4</b> Both the meanings
‘garland’ and
‘crown’
are frequently used in a figurative sense, and in this way <span dir="rtl">עֲטָרָה</span> differs from the other words for royal headdresses,
<span dir="rtl">נֵזֶר</span> and
<span dir="rtl">כֶּתֶר</span>.
