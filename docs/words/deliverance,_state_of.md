## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  See <a href="/sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">ישׁע</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>.

<b>A.2</b>  The etymology of  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> is controversial: morphologically it
seems to be necessary to regard the <i>taw</i> as a formative element, so that the root would be <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span> (<span dir="rtl">ע״ו</span>), but according to its sense(s) an association with <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> has often been thought to be required.

<b>A.3</b>  BDB recorded (448a) that ‘most assign it to  <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span>, but no sufficient
evidence for existence of such a √’. Presumably they meant that there was no evidence for a root <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span> as a by-form of <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>: this is in fact what they say (447b) about <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span>, ‘acc. to most from second. √<span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span> = <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> … (cf. <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> infr.); but actual existence of such a root not proven;
this allows  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> = <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוֹעַ</span>’. On  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> BDB say (after giving its meaning as ‘deliverance, salvation’): ‘= <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> (formed by false anal., as if from √<span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span>, in sense of <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>)’.

<b>A.4</b>  It can no longer be said that ‘most’ favour a derivation of <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> from <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span>. The major recent dictionaries, like BDB, all relate it to  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> (<i>HAL</i>, 1657a; Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small>, 1461a; <i>DCH</i> viii:684). Only a minority of scholars think differently. Kopf (1958:206-207) defended the association with <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span>, but in the form of <span dir="rtl">שָׁוַע</span> = ‘cry’, claiming that it was in turn cognate with Arab. <i>ǵawwata</i> (i.e. a word with the corresponding consonants in the reverse order, so assuming metathesis, a shaky argument according to Barr [1987:97-98]), which means specifically ‘cry <i>for help</i>’. Presumably he saw this as related to the sense of ‘help’ which  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> can have. Sawyer too preferred a connection of <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> with  <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span>, but as a ‘by-form’ of  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> and without detailed discussion (1982:1042; cf. 1037-38). He also allowed the possibility that <span dir="rtl">הושׁיע</span> ‘could’ be the basis for <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>.

<b>B.1</b>  Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small> (1461b) cite an article by Rabin (1963:114-17) as providing discussion of <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, but this is an error, as that part of the article is about  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּקָה</span> (so correctly <i>DCH</i> viii:767).

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  The pattern is <i>taqtul(at)</i> (BL §496r-u). BL indicate that most such nouns are from 
<span dir="rtl">ע״ו</span> roots, but there are three from ‘other weak roots, which are not or are no longer <i>Ayin Yodh/Waw</i>’: 
<span dir="rtl">תקופה</span> (from
<span dir="rtl">הקיף</span>/<span dir="rtl">נקף</span>),  <span dir="rtl">תרופה</span> (cf. <span dir="rtl">רפא</span>) and <span dir="rtl">תשׁועה</span> (from <span dir="rtl">הושׁיע</span>, ‘perhaps under the
influence of  <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span>’. Brockelmann (1908-1913:383, §204a[3]) likewise saw  <span dir="rtl">תשׁועה</span> as modelled on this pattern, but as a secondary form of <span dir="rtl">ישׁועה</span>.

<b>A.2</b>  Regarding the close correspondence in form between  <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> and
<span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, Barth (1894:278) had earlier seen this pair as related to a phenomenon of substitution in Arabic which was distinct from nouns with a genuinely preformative element, where the same sense could be conveyed by nouns beginning with either <i>mem</i> or <i>taw</i> (1894:280-81). This does also
clarify the curious formation of <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> while keeping it fully within the <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> word-group.

<b>B.1</b>  Gevirtz (1892:60\*-61\*) apparently conflated the two phenomena distinguished by Barth (cf. A.2 above) and challenged Barth’s conclusion about the latter group, showing that there generally was a semantic distinction between nouns with different preformatives. Even if Gevirtz is correct in this, it is not relevant to the semantics of <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, since (as Barth saw) the <i>yodh</i> in  <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> is a root-letter and not a formative element.


<b>B.2</b>  BL went on (in §496u) to conjecture that the root √<span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span>was a
secondary development from <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, supposing that the noun <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> was
from <span dir="rtl">שָׁע</span> = ‘helper’: this inverts the argument criticised by BDB and is itself no more persuasive. It was criticised in <i>HAL</i> (1657a),
apparently on the basis that Kopf (1958) had shown that √<span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span> (I) had a cognate of its own in Arab, with a distinct meaning and guttural consonant (cf. 1339-1340).

15:19; 1 Sam 19:5; 2 Sam 23:10, 12; 1 Chron 11:14; Sir 46:1). This may
reflect its particular sense of victory.

<b>A.1</b>  The meaning ‘victory’ is found for some translations in the Pesh
(<i>nṣḥnʾ</i>), Tg ( <span dir="rtl">נִצְחָנָא</span>) and Vg (<i>victoria</i>).


<b>A.2</b>  The translation <i>zdyqwtʾ</i> in the Pesh Ps 50:16 is perhaps under the
influence of  <span dir="rtl">צְדָקָה</span> at the end of the verse (which is also translated
by <i>zdyqwtʾ</i>).


<span id="AVA3"><b>A.3</b></span> The Pesh at Ps 40:11 seems to read <i>zdyqwtʾ</i> ‘righteousness’ as the
translation for  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, but later in the verse  <span dir="rtl">צְדָקָה</span> is translated
by <i>pwrqnʾ</i>, implying that there has been a reversal of the pair.


<b>A.4</b>  The Tg translates by the Hebrew loan-word  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָתָא</span> at 2 Sam
19:3.


<b>A.5</b>  On two occasions the Tg renders the noun  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> by the verbal
form  <span dir="rtl">פַּרִיק</span> ‘redeemer’ (Isa 46:13; 1 Chron 19:12), indicating that it
is interpreting the noun as denoting a person. This is not a feature of
the other Versions.


<b>B.1</b>  In the Pesh <i>tšbḥtʾ</i> ‘praise’ at Ps 71:15 may well be a contextual
interpretation, encouraged by the preceding phrase  <span dir="rtl">כל היום</span> (cf. Ps 44:9;
119:164; 145:2): note also how Pesh introduces <i>šbḥ</i> before <i>prq</i> in Ps
13:6.

<b>A.1</b> See 
<a href="/sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#5-lexicalsemantic-fields"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">ישׁע</span>: Lexical/Semantic Fields A.4</a>.


<b>A.2</b>   <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> is found in parallelism with  <span dir="rtl">צְדָקָה</span> ‘righteousness’ (Isa
46:13a; Ps 40:11; 71:15),  <span dir="rtl">תִּפְאֶרֶת</span> ‘glory, honour’ (Isa 46:13b),
 <span dir="rtl">מָעוּז</span> ‘stronghold’ (Ps 37:39),  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> ‘help’ (Ps 60:13; 108:13),  <span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד
<span dir="rtl">‘loving kindness’ (Ps 119:41), and the verb  <span dir="rtl">מַלֵּט</span> ‘to save’ (Ps 33:17).


<span id="LSFA3"><b>A.3</b></span>  In 11 of its 34 occurrences in the OT it is in prose passages (see Driver 1890:90).

## 6. Exegesis


<b>A.1</b>  <i>HAL’s</i> glosses, ‘Hilfe, Rettung, Sieg’ (1657), cover the main uses
of  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>. BDB divides the lexeme into two prime meanings of
‘deliverance, salvation’ (448), where ‘deliverance’ should be understood
as a physical act involving deliverance from battle, but also a general
state rather than an action of victory and of help. BDB’s definition of
 <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> includes the gloss ‘rescue’ (447), which might have been helpful
here also.


<b>A.2</b>  In prose  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> denotes a victory over one’s enemies that may
imply deliverance from one’s opponents (Judg 15:18; 1 Sam 11:9, 13;
19:5; 2 Sam 19:3; 23:10, 12; 2 Kgs 5:1; 2 Kgs 13:17 [2x]), especially
when it is the object of the verbs  <span dir="rtl">נָתַן</span> ‘to give’ or  <span dir="rtl">עָשָׂה</span> ‘to make’
(e.g. Judg 15:18; 1 Sam 19:5). This meaning is clear for  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>,
whilst  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is used in the context of victory but does not precisely
denote it.  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> in prose in similar manner denotes assistance in
battle (1 Chron 19:12).



<span id="ExA3"><b>A.3</b></span>  In verse  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> may denote victory (Ps 33:17; 144:10; Prov
11:14; 21:31; 24:6) and also assistance (Ps 60:13; 108:13; 146:3), but
equally often seems to denote the well-being that God will bring about
(Isa 45:17; 46:13; Jer 3:23; Lam 3:26; Ps 119:41, 81). This might be the
protection afforded to Israel, or the haven that God provides for the
righteous (Ps 37:39). The synonymous parallelism with  <span dir="rtl">מָעוּז
<span dir="rtl">‘stronghold’ at Ps 37:39 suggests that  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> is a state of defence
or protection.


<b>A.4</b>  On one occasion  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> (+ 1 sg. pronominal suffix) is an epithet
of the Lord.


<b>A.5</b>  In 2 Chron 6:41 Solomon prays that the priests may be ‘clothed with’
 <span dir="rtl">תשׁועה</span>, where clothing is a metaphor for endowment, as it is in Ps
132:8-9, on which this part of the prayer is closely modelled. Ps 132:9
speaks of being clothed with  <span dir="rtl">צֶדֶק</span>, but the Chronicler has preferred
 <span dir="rtl">תשׁועה</span> on the basis of  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> in the same idiom later in the psalm (v.
16), perhaps because he uses the root  <span dir="rtl">צדק</span> only in a moral sense
elsewhere and this may have seemed inappropriate here.

## 7. Conclusion


<b>A.1</b>  A  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> is often ‘given’ or ‘made’ (<a href="#SynA2">Syntagmatics A.2</a>) and is
only described in the OT by the adjective ‘great’ (<a href="#SynA7">Syntagmatics A.7</a>).
These distinctive features of the noun may reflect its meanings in some
cases of ‘victory’ and ‘help’, translations that the versions
occasionally choose (<a href="#AVA3">Ancient Versions A.3</a>). Although the versions are not
consistent in such renderings for the same passages, this perhaps
strengthens the case that they saw such meanings in the word rather than
weakens it. Their renderings are not affected by the context of one
particular passage, but are reflected in the use of the lexeme more
generally.


<b>A.2</b>  The more prosaic meaning of  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> (outlined in A.1 above) in
comparison with  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> or  <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> is explained by its 11 appearances
in prose texts in contrast to the latter (<a href="#LSFA3">Lexical/Semantics Field(s)
A.3</a>).


<b>A.3</b>  Although the meaning victory in battle suggests that  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> could denote deliverance, it often means little more than a state of
well-being brought about by God (<a href="#ExA3">Exegesis A.3</a>). The victory in battle is usually spoken about in the past so that it does not denote so much an act of deliverance, but more the state into which one has been brought.
As  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> it is only found in the singular.


<b>A.4</b>  The usage of  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, as indicated by Syntagmatics, Versions,
Lexical Fields and Exegesis, confirms its association with the  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> group, even if its formal characteristics seem at first sight to point
in a different direction.
