<b>A.1</b> 

## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  <i>Semitic</i>: 
The √<i>lqḥ</i> is general Semitic and has the basic meaning ‘to grasp, take’, see e.g. Klein, <i>CEDHL</i>, 305; Leslau, <i>CDG</i>, 317; Del Olmo Lete & Sanmartín, <i>DULAT</i>, 501.



<i>Akkadian</i>: The word occurs in the Akkadian of Ugarit (Tawil, <i>ALCBH</i>, 215-6. See below.




<i>Ugaritic</i>: It has been suggested that Ugaritic <i>mqḥm</i> (a dual) means ‘forceps’ or ‘pincers’ (for a survey of opinions see Watson 2002, 923). This is apparently the same word as the Hebrew <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span>, be it that the <i>l</i> was assimilated, as is often the case with forms of √<i>lqḥ</i>. In KTU 4.123:21 <i>mqḥm</i> occurs between various containers in the phrase <i>w . qpt . w . mqḥm</i> which might be interpreted as ‘and a box with a forceps’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מֹאזְנַיִם</span>). KTU 4.127:4 <i>mqḥ mqḥm</i> ‘an excellent forceps’ occurs in broken context. KTU 4. 385:3 <i>spl . mšlt . wmqḥm</i> might be rendered ‘a bowl, a flint-knife and a forceps’ -- it has been suggested that we are dealing with a physician’s equipment here (Stieglitz 1981).

This term is also attested in syllabic Ugaritic transcription. In a list of bronze tools <i>PRU</i> VI, No. 157:13-14 mentions 1 <i>ma-qa-ḫa išāti</i> | 1 <i>ma-qa-ḫa me-e</i> ‘1 forceps for fire’ | ‘1 forceps for intestines’ (cf. Hebr. <span dir="rtl">מֵּעִים</span>). Especially the former tallies with the Hebrew use of the tool in Isa 6:6. Also attested in the Akkadian of Ugarit are two <i>ša la-qí išāti siparri</i> ‘bronze forceps to pick up fire’ (<i>PRU</i> III, 186:38), mentioned just after seven torches. 


<i>Punic</i>: Punic <i>mlqḥ</i> is a different word, possibly meaning ‘catch-net’  (Krahmalkov, <i>PPD</i>, 645; cf. Hoftijzer & Jongeling, <i>DNSI</i>, 645: uncertain).


<i>Postbiblical Hebrew</i>: See section 6 below.

## <a id="AV"></a>4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions (αʹ, σʹ, θʹ)</b>:  

* Exod 25:38(37) ἐπαρυστήρ sing. according to*LSJ</i>, 611: ‘vessel for pouring oil into 
a lamp’; similarly <i>GELS-L</i>, 165: ‘vessel for pouring oil (into 
a lamp), funnel’. 1 Kgs 7:49 (LXX 7:35) ἐπαρυστρίς plur., a neologism with the same meaning.  This rendering is also used for → <span dir="rtl">מַחְתָֹּה</span><br>in Exod 37:23 [LXX 38:17]; Num 4:9, 
and for → <span dir="rtl">מוּצָקָה</span>  in Zech 4:2. In Exod 37:23 (LXX 38:17); Num 4:9; Isa 6:6; 2 Chron 4:21the LXX opts for λαβίς (sing. in Isa 6:6; elsewhere plur.), according to <i>LSJ</i>, 1021: ‘handle’, ‘holder’, ‘forceps’, ‘clamps’, ‘tongs, snuffers to trim lamps’. The latter renderings are also given by <i>GELS-L</i>, 275.


<b>b.  Peshitta (Pesh):</b>  

* The normal rendering is <i>malq <sup>eṭā</sup></i>, ‘tweezers, snuffers’ according to Payne Smith (Margoliouth), <i>CSD</i>, 278. The verb <i>lqḥ</i> means ‘to pick, glean’. Only in Isa 6:6 <i>kalb <sup>etā</sup></i> is chosen for which Payne Smith (Margoliouth), <i>CSD</i>, 215 offers the renderings ‘tongs, pincers, tweezers’. 2 Chron 4:21 is lacking in Pesh.



<b>c. Targum (Tg):</b>  

* Tg<sup>O</sup> on Exod 25:38; 37:23; Num 4:9 <span dir="rtl">ציבתא</span> plur. (Levy, <i>CWT</i>, Bd. 2, 314: ‘Zange, Lichtschneuze’; Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1260: ‘tongs’). 
Tg<sup>N</sup>, Tg<sup>PsJ</sup>, Fragment 
Targum MS Vatican Ebr. 440 (on Num 4:9) <span dir="rtl">מלקחא</span>  plur. (Levy, <i>CWT</i>, Bd. 2, 43: ‘Zangen’, ‘Lichtschneuzen’; 
Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 793: ‘snuffers’; Sokoloff, <i>DJPA</i>, 311: ‘tong, 
snuffer’).  Tg 1 Kgs 7:49; 2 Chron 4:21 <span dir="rtl">ציבתא</span> plur. like Tg<sup>O</sup>. In Isa 6:6 Tg offers a free paraphrasis.



<b>d.  Vulgate (Vg):</b>  

* 
Exod 25:38; 37:23 <i>emunctorium</i> plur., 
‘snuffers’ (in Num 4:9  → <span dir="rtl">מַחְתָֹּה</span> plur. is translated with <i>emunctoria</i>). Num 4:9; 1 Kgs 
7:49; Isa 6:6; 2 Chron 4:21 <i>forceps</i> (sing. in 
Isa 6:6; elsewhere plur.), ‘(pair of) tongs, pincers, forceps’ (<i>LD</i>, 767).


<b>A.1</b> 
SP<sup>T</sup>: 
<span dir="rtl">מלקחה</span> which Tal, <i>DSA</i>, 445, describes as a ‘receptacle’ but which on the analogy of Tg and Pesh should probably be understood as ‘forceps, tongs’.

## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Textual Evidence


<b>A.1</b> With the exception of Isa 6:6, <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span>  (transliterated by St. Jerome as <i>malcaim</i>; see  Sperber 1937-8, 191, 237), a dualis describing an object
consisting of two parts (cf. König 1897, § 257a), and a derivative of √<span dir="rtl">לקח</span>, is used to denote some utensils specifically intended for 
servicing the lamps (→ <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span>) of the sanctuary lampstand (→ <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span>), of the Tabernacle (Exod 25:38; 37:23; Num 4:9), as well as of the Temple 
of Solomon (1 Kgs 7:49 = 2 Chron 4:21). They are 
made of respectively ‘pure gold’ (<span dir="rtl">טָהֹור</span> <span dir="rtl">זָהָב</span>, Exod 25:38; 37:23) and ‘gold’ (1 Kgs 7:49 = 2 Chron 4:21). In Exod 25:38; 37:23 they are 
mentioned together with ‘firepans’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מַחְתָֹּה</span> plur.), in Num 4:9 moreover with such things as containers and 
funnels for the lampstand’s oil  (<span dir="rtl">שַׁמְנָהּ</span> <span dir="rtl">כָּל&thinsp;־כְּלֵי</span>, cf. also Exod 30:27; 31:8; 35:14; 39:37).


In Isa 6:6, where <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span> is used for taking and holding a live coal from the incense 
altar of the Temple, it evidently denotes a light type of tongs or forceps. Elsewhere the term presumably stands 
for a tool used for servicing 
the wicks of the lamps, such as adjusting the wicks, 
holding them while trimming (→ <span dir="rtl">מְזַמֶּרֶת</span>), removing old wicks and putting in new ones. In translations, on the 
assumption that there was more than one pair of 
tongs, one finds the rendering ‘snuffers’ for  <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span> too. However, because in 1 Kgs 7:49f. = 2 Chron 4:21f.  <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span> and <span dir="rtl">מְזַמְּרֹות</span> are mentioned side by side it  is likely that the terms refer to two different utensils.Another proposal is that lids for 
covering the lamps are meant so that no dirt 
would fall into the oil (Nachmanides; see Chavel 1973, 460-1). Finally it has been suggested that the  <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span> refer to pliers to remove the hot lamps from the stand (cf. Holzinger 1900, 126). 

In the Temple Scroll from Cave 11 in the Judean Desert (11Q19: IX.10-11) <span dir="rtl">ככרים</span> <span dir="rtl">כולה</span> <span dir="rtl">ומלקחיה</span> <span dir="rtl">מזמרתיה</span>  ‘its [trimming knives] and its <span dir="rtl">מלקחים</span>, two talents in total’ occurs, suggesting fairly heavy tools. However, this may rest on interpretation of the biblical occurrences.

The rabbinic testimony is based on the biblical testimony and has no independent value. There are no indications supporting the hypothesis that the <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span> were attached to the lamp (against Krauss, <i>TA</i>, Bd. 1, 71, 403, n. 217).





### 6.2 Pictorial Material

<b>A.1</b> In Tell el-Amarna, Egypt, forceps designed like human hands have been found that may have been used to pull up lampwicks (<i>ISBE</i>, vol. 4, 558).

### 6.3 Archaeology

<b>A.1</b> [Will be added later.]

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> The <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span> denote a pair of tongs or forceps. They were used in the cult to pick up hot coals from the altar (fire was difficult to make) or were used for servicing the wicks of the lamps, such as adjusting them, 
holding them while trimming (→ <span dir="rtl">מְזַמֶּרֶת</span>), removing old wicks and putting in new ones. Most ancient versions support this interpretation. A related word in Ugaritic suggests that such forceps were also used for other purposes requiring a delicate instrument to pick up small objects.
