* Torah: Exod 35:25, 26. <br>

<span id="Sam"><b>A.1</b></span>
In MT Exod 35:25a, the plural form
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טָווּ</span>,
‘they spun’, has a singular form as its subject
(<i>constructio ad sententiam</i>):
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">וְכָל־אִשָּׁה חַכְמַת־לֵב בְּיָדֶיהָ טָווּ</span>,
‘and every woman wise of heart (sg.) – with her (sg.) hands they spun (pl.)’.
In SP the consonantal text of Exod 35:25a differs from MT: 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">וכל אשה חכמת לב בידה טוה</span>
(Tal & Florentin 2010:303). 
With reference to the sg. forms <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יבוא</span> in SP 35:10
and <span dir="rtl" lang="he">הביא</span> in SP 35:22, 
William Propp (2006:642, 662) suggested that the adaptation of the verbal form <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוו</span> to <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>
was due to grammatical adjustment resulting in a more appropriate verbal form (3.f.sg.).
However, since the expected feminine form would then be 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טותה</span>,
‘she spun’ (cf. Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §79), it is better to interpret <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>
in SP as a noun (cf. <i>DCH</i> <small>III</small>, 360 s.v. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טַוָּה</span>), or the 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">ה</span>–
as a possessive suffix (3.f.sg.) and –<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טו</span> as representing a shorter noun
(Tal & Florentin 2010:687-88): 
‘and every woman wise of heart – in her hand was (</i>her</i>?) <i>spun yarn</i>’. 
This interpretation is confirmed by the rendering in Tg<sup><small>Smr</small></sup> by <span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזלה</span> (var.: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזל</span>; <i>STP</i> <small>I</small>, 372-73): <span dir="rtl" lang="he">באדה עזלה</span>,
‘in her hand was (</i>her</i>?) <i>spun yarn</i>’. 
Similarly, the Sam. tradition interpreted <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מטוה</span> in Exod 35:25b as a combination of the preposition <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מן</span>
and the form <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>: 
‘and they brought – <i>from</i> (<i>her</i>?) <i>spun yarn</i> 
– bluish purple and reddish purple ...’; see Tg<sup><small>Smr</small></sup> <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מן עזלה</span>,
‘from (her?) spun yarn’.
In Exod 35:26, however, Tg<sup><small>Smr</small></sup> interprets 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוו</span>
(SP and MT) as a verbal form and renders it as
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזלו</span>
‘they spun’: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">וכל נשיה ... עזלו ית עזיה</span>, ‘and all the women ... <i>spun</i> the goat hair’.
See further Tal, <i>DSA</i>, 630.




##<span id="RCM">1. Root and Comparative Material</span>


<b>A.1</b>  <i>Root</i>:
The verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span> has cognates in several Semitic languages,
certainly in Akk. (A.3), PBHeb. (A.5) and JAram. (A.6), but probably also in 
Arab. and Eth. (A.7, A.8)
and possibly in BAram. and Syr. (A.4).



<b>A.2</b> <i>Derivatives</i>:
The noun <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַטְוֶה</span>, ‘yarn’, ‘that which has been spun’, in Exod 35:25 is a deriv. of the verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span> (cf. BL, 491 mζ, nζ).
For the deviating Sam. interpretation of the form <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מטוה</span>, see <a href="#Sam">Introduction A.1</a>.





<span id="Akkadian"><b>A.3</b>  <i>Akkadian</i>: 
The Akk. cognate <i>ṭamû</i> 
(sometimes <i>ṭawû</i> or <i>ṭemû</i>; also written <small>NU.NU</small>) 
means ‘to spin, twist, braid, entwine’. See <i>CAD</i> Ṭ, 45-46 (similarly <i>AHw</i> <small>III</small>, 1382),
with quotations from several texts referring to spinning with a 
<sup><small><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">giš</span></sup><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">bal</span></small> = <i>pilakku</i>, ‘spindle’ 
(→ <a href="/words/pelek/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span></a>). 
The quoted phrases demonstrate that the verb <i>ṭamû</i> 
was not only used for spinning threads from raw fibres,
but also for twisting 
together threads that had already been spun
(<i>CAD</i> Ṭ, 46; cf. Wisti Lassen 2010:277):
<i>qê eṣpi taṭammīma</i>, 
‘you spin a double-stranded thread’;
<i>šipāte peṣâte šipāte ṣal</i>[<i>māte</i>] <i>qâ eṣpa ina pilakki iṭme
qâ ṣīra qâ rabâ qâ bitru</i>[<i>ma</i>],
‘from white wool and black wool she spun a double-stranded thread with a spindle, a mighty thread, a great thread, a multicolo[ured] thread’.


<b>A.4</b> <i>Biblical Aramaic and Syriac</i>: 
It has been suggested that the BAram. word
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טְוָת</span>
in Dan 6:19 is a cognate of BHeb. 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:1')">1</a></sup>
With reference to Syr. ܛܘܝ  (<i>ṭwy</i>), ‘to be hungry’ (cf. Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 516),
BAram. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טְוָת</span> is interpreted as an adverb meaning ‘fasting’: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">וּבָת טְוָת</span>,
‘he (the king) spent the night fasting’. 
However, it has become quite dubious whether BHeb. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>  and BAram. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טְוָת</span>, are really cognates 
(see <i>HALOT</i>, 1883 s.v. \*<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>).  

[^1]: Cf. GB, 274 s.v. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>; KBL, 350 s.v. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>, 1078-79 s.v. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>  and <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טְוָת</span>; <i>HALOT</i>, 372 s.v. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>; Ges<sup><small>18</small></sup>, 421 s.v. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>.


<b>A.5</b>  <i><span id="PBH">Postbiblical Hebrew</span></i>:
The verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span> does not occur in 
Ben Sira and the non-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls. 
It does occur in rabbinic Heb., where it denotes the processing of wool (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">צֶמֶר</span>;
tKelim Bava Batra 1:6, bShabbat 74b) 
or flax (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פִּשְׁתָּן</span>; 
mNegaʿim 2:4,  bZevaḥim 79a) 
with a spindle (→ <a href="/words/pelek/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span></a>; bKetubbot 72b). 
tKelim Bava Batra 1:6 includes the expression
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טָווּי שֶעַל גַּבֵּי הַפֶּלֶך</span>,
‘spun (wool) which is on the spindle’. 
See further <a href="#RAB">Textual Evidence A.3</a>. 

<b>A.6</b>  <i>Jewish Aramaic</i>: 
The verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוי</span>/<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>, ‘to spin (yarn)’, 
occurs occasionally in JAram.,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:2')">2</a></sup> 
where it is apparently a loanword from Hebrew.
The more usual JAram. verb with the meaning ‘to spin’ is
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזל</span><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:3')">3</a></sup>
(cf. Syr. <span dir="rtl">ܥܙܠ</span>; see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>).

<b>A.7</b>  <i>Arabic</i>:
Many BHeb. dictionaries suggest that Arab. <i>ṭawā</i>, ‘to fold, wind’, is a cognate of BHeb. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:4')">4</a></sup> 
For the Arab. verb, see Lane

<b>A.8</b>  <i>Ethiopic</i>: 
In Eth., the verb <i>ṭawaya</i> means ‘to be twisted’ (<i>CDG</i>, 600). 
Many BHeb. dictionaries regard it as a cognate of Heb.
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:5')">5</a></sup>

##<span id="FC">2. Formal Characteristics</span>
<b>A.1</b> 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>  is a ל״ה  verb
(cf. Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §79).
The <span dir="rtl" lang="he">ה</span>– is a <i>mater lectionis</i>,
but the –<span dir="rtl" lang="he">ו</span>– is retained in the pronunciation; cf. the pass.part. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טָווּי</span>, ‘spun’, in <a href="#PBH">Postbiblical Hebrew</a>. 
The noun <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַטְוֶה</span> (Exod 35:25) is a <i>maqtal</i>/<i>maqtil</i> form (BL, 491 mζ, nζ).


##<span id="Syn">3. Syntagmatics</span>
<b>A.1</b> In Exod 35:25, <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טָווּ</span>, ‘they spun’ (pl.), has 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">כָּל־אִשָּׁה חַכְמַת־לֵב</span>, ‘every woman wise of heart’ (sg.), as its grammatical subject (<i>constructio ad sententiam</i>). 
In Exod 35:26, <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טָווּ</span>, ‘they spun’, has <span dir="rtl" lang="he">כָּל־הַנָּשִׁים אֲשֶׁר נָשָׂא לִבָּן אֹתָנָה בְּחָכְמָה</span>, ‘all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom’, 
as its grammatical subject. 

<b>A.2</b> 
In Exod 35:26, <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טָווּ</span>, ‘they spun’, has <span dir="rtl" lang="he">אֶת הָעִזִּים</span>, here ‘goat hair’, 
as its direct object. The Sam. tradition interpreted <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוו</span> in SP Exod 35:26 as a pi‘el form 
(vocalisation: <i>ṭuwwu</i>; see 
Ben-Ḥayyim 2000:88, 161), also with 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">את העזים</span> as direct object.

<b>A.3</b> In Exod 35:25
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span> is used with the preposition <span dir="rtl" lang="he">בְּ</span> introducing the means or instrument: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">בְּיָדֶיהָ</span>,
‘with her hands’.

<b>A.1</b> The ancient versions appear to be unanimous in translating <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span> by a common word meaning ‘to spin’.


##<span id="LSF">5. Lexical/Semantic Fields</span>

<b>A.1</b> 
In BHeb., the semantic field of spinning includes the verb 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>, ‘to spin’ (Exod 35:25-26), and its derivative <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַטְוֶה</span>, ‘spun yarn’ (Exod 35:25), as well as the noun 
→ <a href="/words/pelek/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span></a>, which denotes the spindle, the instrument with which the spinning was performed.
The verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שׁזר</span>, ‘to twist’ 
(see <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מָשְׁזָר</span> in Exod 26:1, etc.), denotes an activity that was probably also covered by the verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span> 
and that seems to have been performed also with a <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span>.
If in Prov 31:19 the noun 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">כִּישׁוֹר</span> designates a distaff or another instrument used for spinning, it belongs to the same semantic field.


##<span id="Exe">6. Exegesis</span>

###<span id="Exe-lit">6.1 Textual Evidence</span>

<b>A.1</b> Not only the ancient versions but also the dictionaries of BHeb. agree that the verb 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span> means ‘to spin’.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:10')">10</a></sup> 
Exod 35:25-26 recounts that women spun different materials
that had been collected previously (Exod 25:4; 35:6, 23):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/words/thkeleth"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּכֵלֶת</span></a>,
‘bluish purple’,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/words/2argaman"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">אַרְגָּמָן</span></a>,
‘reddish purple’,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<a href="/words/shani_1"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">תּוֹלַעַת (הַ)שָָּׁנִי</span></a>, ‘scarlet’, ‘bright red’,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span>,
‘fine linen’,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span dir="rtl" lang="he">עִזִּים</span>, ‘goat hair’.   
The three designations <a href="/words/thkeleth"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּכֵלֶת</span></a>,
<a href="/words/2argaman"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">אַרְגָּמָן</span></a>, and 
<a href="/words/shani_1"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">תּוֹלַעַת (הַ)שָָּׁנִי</span></a> apparently denote sheep wool that had been coloured with these costly dyes 
before it was spun. 
Linen usually remained undyed, since its cellulose fibres do not easily absorb dyes<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:11')">11</a></sup>
(but cf. Ezek 27:7). 
Whenever <span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּכֵלֶת</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">אַרְגָּמָן</span>,
and <span dir="rtl" lang="he">תּוֹלַעַת (הַ)שָָּׁנִי</span>
occur together, they are mentioned in this order. 
They form a distinctive group, with 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span>, ‘fine linen’,
mentioned either before them (Exod 26:1; 36:8; 39:29),
or after them (Exod 25:4; 26:31, 36; 27:16; 28:5, 6, 8, 15; 35:6, 23, 25, 35; 36:35, 37; 38:18, 23; 39:2, 3, 5, 8), or without references to 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span> in the same context (Exod 28:33; 39:1, 24).   
Exod 35:26 refers separately to the spinning of the coarse 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">עִזִּים</span>, ‘goat hair’
(also in Num 31:20; 1 Sam 19:13, 16), 
which was apparently left undyed and was used to produce the protective curtains (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">יְרִיעֹת</span>)
of the tent (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">אֹהֶל</span>) 
covering the sanctuary (26:7; 36:14).  
Although Exod 35:25 says that the women spun with their hands 
(<span dir="rtl" lang="he">בְּיָדֶיהָ</span>),
this certainly does not exclude that they made use of a → <a href="/words/pelek/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span></a>, ‘spindle’,
the common instrument with which spinning went much faster and easier and which was driven with the hand. 
In order to perform the spinning properly, the female spinners needed to be ‘wise of heart’ (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">חַכְמַת־לֵב</span>, 35:25; cf. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">בְּחָכְמָה</span>, 35:26).
After the women had spun the yarn (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַטְוֶה</span>),
it was brought away, apparently by others (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">וַיָּבִיאוּ</span>, 3.m.pl., 35:25; cf. Propp 2006:662),
to be processed further.
Among the craftsmen who made use of the spun yarn were producers of multicoloured cloth (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">רֹקֵם</span>,
26:36; 27:16; 35:35; 36:37; 38:18, 23; 39:29)
and weavers (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">אֹרֵג</span>, 28:32; 35:35; 39:22, 27). 
The spun <span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּכֵלֶת</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">אַרְגָּמָן</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">תּוֹלַעַת (הַ)שָָּׁנִי</span>, and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span> were used together to produce luxury curtains enclosing the sanctuary (26:1; 36:8: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יְרִיעֹת</span>),
the curtain separating the Holy of Holies from the rest of the 
tent (26:31; 36:35: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פָּרֹכֶת</span>),
and the curtains (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מָסָךְ</span>)
shutting off the entrance to the tent (26:36; 36:37)
and the entrance of the court (27:16; 38:18).
The same kinds of spun yarn were processed together for the clothes of Aaron and other priests ministering in the sanctuary (28:5-6, 8, 15, 33; 39:1-3, 5, 8, 24, 29).
Other objects were made only of spun 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּכֵלֶת</span>
(26:4; 28:28, 31, 37; 36:11; 39:21, 22)
or only of spun <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span>, ‘fine linen’ (27:9, 18; 28:39; 38:9, 16; 39:27-28).

<b>A.2</b> 
<span id="twisted">In the verses referring to the collection of linen before it was spun (Exod 25:4; 35:6, 23, 25),</span>
the noun <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span>, ‘fine linen’, is never modified by a following <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מָשְׁזָר</span>, ‘twisted’ (part.hoph. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שׁזר</span>). 
Linen ready to be used for the production of fabrics 
is usually designated as 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ מָשְׁזָר</span>, ‘twisted fine linen’,
and as <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span> – without <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מָשְׁזָר</span> –
only in 28:5, 39; 39:3, 27-28.
The texts do not clearly indicate whether 
the twisting of the linen was performed by the spinning women, as part of the 
work designated by <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>,
or by the craftsmen who took care of the further processing of the materials
(see <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁשׁ</span> without <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מָשְׁזָר</span> in 35:35 and 38:23). 
However, since the twisting of the linen threads was usually performed with a → <a href="/words/pelek/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span></a>, ‘spindle’, which was regarded as a women’s instrument,
the twisting was probably also done by the women.
See also the 
<a href="#Akkadian">Akk. verb <i>ṭamû</i></a>, which denotes the spinning as well as the twisting of threads.

<b>A.3</b> <span id="RAB">The interpretation of <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>  as relating to forming yarn is </span>
confirmed by rabbinic texts,
which mention the → <a href="/words/pelek/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span></a>, ‘spindle’, as the instrument with which 
the spinning was performed
(see <a href="#PBH">Postbiblical Hebrew</a>).
tBerakhot 6:2 describes a specific order in which the processing of the raw materials took place 
when it says with regard to Adam: 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">ולא לבש חלוק אחד עד שגזז וליבן וניפץ/ס וצבע וטווה וארג ותפר ואחר כך לבש</span>,
‘he did not wear a single shirt until he had cut/shorn and washed and beaten and dyed and spun and woven and sewed; and after that he wore it.’
Other texts refer to exactly the same sequence of actions before the fibres were spun (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>): 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גזז</span>, ‘to cut/shear’;
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">לבן</span> pi., ‘to wash’; 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">נפץ/ס</span> pi., ‘to beat’; 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">צבע</span>, ‘to dye’ (yBerakhot 9, 13c; 
mShabbat 7:2; cf. 13:4). 
These texts indicate that, after the spinning, the spun yarn (designated as <span dir="rtl" lang="he">חוּט</span>, ‘thread’, in mShabbat 7:2; 13:1, 4) was used for weaving (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">ארג</span>).
Exod 35:25-26 also presupposes that the wool had been dyed before it was spun.
bBerakhot 58a refers to the same sequence of actions as the other rabbinic texts, but omits the reference to dyeing.

<b>A.1</b> In the Cave of the Letters (cave 5-6) in Naḥal Ḥever, three wooden and two stone spindle whorls were found, together with a bundle of dyed, unspun wool and 
balls of woollen and linen threads, all with 135 <small>CE</small> as the <i>terminus ad quem</i> (Yadin 1963:35-36, 130-32, 169-88, 252, 256, plates 36, 59, 88).

##<span id="Con">7. Conclusion</span>

<b>A.1</b> 
In Biblical Hebrew, the verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">טוה</span>  means ‘to spin’. It designates the production of threads from fibres, especially wool and flax, but apparently also 
the plying together of two or more thin threads to form a stronger yarn (see Akkadian <a href="#Akkadian"><i>ṭamû</i></a> 
and Biblical Hebrew <a href="#twisted">שֵׁשׁ מָשְׁזָר</a>). 
These activities were usually carried out with a → <a href="/words/pelek/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">פֶּלֶךְ</span></a>, ‘spindle’.
