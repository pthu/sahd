## Introduction

Grammatical Type: noun/adj.   
Occurrences: 2x HB (0/1/1); 0x Sir; 1x Qum; 0x inscr. (Total: 3).

* Nebiim: Isa 32:5;
* Ketubim: Job 34:19;
* Qum: 4Q165 6:3.
* Text doubtful: -


<b>A.1</b>  The only occurrence at Qumran is in the citation of Isa 32:5 in a
pesher of Isaiah, 4Q165 6:3.


<b>B.1</b>  It is unlikely that Isa 22:5 should be included within the list of occurrences of this lexeme. Most interpret the noun here as a ‘cry’, and <i>HALOT</i> (1444) classes it as a hapax legomenon. Vg, nevertheless, translates it as <i>magnificus</i>, implying that it saw some connection with the other two occurrences (Isa 32:5; Job 34:19).

<b>B.2</b>  Another occurrence of  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> has been posited in Job 34:20 by the emendation of  <span dir="rtl">יְגֹעֲשׁוּ עָם</span> to  <span dir="rtl">יִגְוְעוּ שׁוֹעִים</span> (Fohrer 1989:463-64,
following Hölscher and others; cf. Driver & Gray 1921:258; <i>BHS</i>). But it remains uncertain and can play no part in the argument here.

Qere/Ketiv: none.

## 1. Root and Comparative Material</span>


<b>A.1</b>  A detailed bibliography of the debate over the root is contained in <i>HALOT</i> (1444). In Hebrew the biliteral root is probably also attested in a number of PNN with a medial <i>u</i>-vowel: the form <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעַ</span> occurs in Gen 38:2, 12; 1 Chron 2:3, and a feminine form  <span dir="rtl">שׁוּעָא</span> in 1 Chron 7:32; also the compound (fem.) name <span dir="rtl">בַּת־שׁוּעַ</span> and the theophorous names <span dir="rtl">אֲבִישׁוּעַ</span>, <span dir="rtl">אֱלִישׁוּעַ</span>,  <span dir="rtl">יְהוֹשׁוּעַ</span> and <span dir="rtl">מַלכִישׁוּעַ</span>. Further possible occurrences of this element in extra-biblical PNN are noted by Propp (1999:617): Canaanite/Phoenician  <span dir="rtl">אדנשע</span> and Phoenician <span dir="rtl">שעבׄעל</span>. Of three possible Ugaritic cognates <i>ṯʿ</i> as a title or epithet of Keret (<i>KTU</i> 1.14:IV.37 and par.) and, apparently, of dead and deified kings of Ugarit as the
recipients of offerings in the sense ‘hero, noble’ (so <i>DULAT</i><small><sup> 1</sup></small>, 892-93, as earlier Gibson 1978:160; cf. Akk. <i>šuwāʾu(m)</i> = <i>šuʾû</i> as a synonym
of <i>šarru</i>, <i>AHw</i>, 1295; <i>CAD</i> Š.3:417) is the most likely to be related to the meaning indicated by the parallelism in Isa 32:5 and Job 34:19. <i>HALOT</i> (1444), like many before it, prefers to associate  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> with senses of Arab. <i>wasiʿa</i> such as ‘noble, generous’, and Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small> (1335) persists with this, even though it has given pride of place to
the Ugaritic and Akkadian parallels in its treatment of the root (1334).
Even if the etymology of <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> based on Arab. <i>wasiʿa</i> is preferred,
however, it cannot support an association of <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> with the core group of <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> lexemes, since they are no longer regarded as cognate with Arab. <i>wasiʿa</i> (see 
<a href="/sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">יָשַׁע</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>). Such an
association would only be possible with  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, whose form and
meaning (sometimes ‘help’, perhaps related to ‘generosity’) could be linked to a Hebrew root  <span dir="rtl">שׁוע</span> understood in this way. Yet the study of <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> has found that its predominant meanings concern the effects of
such help rather than the help itself (see <a href="#Con"><span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>: Conclusions</a>) and its root,
if not <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, is more likely to be a by-form of that than the root from
which the noun  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is derived.


## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  n.m. of type <i>qāl</i> (BL, 451 §61n).


## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is the subject of 

* <span dir="rtl">אמר</span> <i>niph.</i> with <span dir="rtl">לֹא</span> and <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> + <span dir="rtl">כִּילַי</span>, ‘villain’: Isa 32:5; the construction is more common with <span dir="rtl">קרא</span> <i>niph.</i>, as
in the previous stich; 
* <span dir="rtl">נכר</span> <i>niph.</i> with  <span dir="rtl">לֹא</span> and  <span dir="rtl">עַל</span> +
 <span dir="rtl">דַּל</span> ‘poor’, ‘lowly’ (Job 34:19); 
* if the emendation of Job 34:20 is
accepted, also of <span dir="rtl">גוע</span> <i>qal</i>.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>:

* ἁδρός, ‘stout’ pl.: Job 34:19;
* σιγάω impv., ‘to be silent’:  Isa 32:5(?).

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܘܩܐ</span> (<i>pārōqā</i>), ‘saviour, liberator’: Isa 32:5;
* no equivalent: Job 34:19.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: O/K)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">שׁועא</span>, ‘protector(?)’: Job 34:19 (see A.3);
* <span dir="rtl">תקיף</span>, ‘strong’ pl.: Isa 32:5.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>maior</i>, ‘great’: Isa 32:5;
* <i>tyrannus</i>, ‘tyrant’: Job 34:19.


<b>A.1</b> LXX to Job 34:19 and Vg both here and in Isa 32:5 interpret <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> as denoting someone powerful, like Tg in Isa 32:5.

<b>A.2</b>  The Pesh to Isa 32:5 infers a connection with the verb <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, ‘to save’.

<b>A.3</b> <span dir="rtl">שׁועא</span> of Tg at Job 34:19 has a formal similarity to the Hebrew noun, and its meaning ‘protector’ suggests that the Targumist here also sees a connection with the Hebrew verb <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, ‘to save’. But Jastrow (<i>DTT</i>, 1538), who gives no other occurrences of it, infers the meaning ‘protector’ from the occurrence of the same word in Prov 30:19 in the sense ‘rock’, which is more widespread in Syriac. It may be better to see <span dir="rtl">שׁועא</span> here as borrowed from the Heb. original.

<b>B.1</b>  In LXX σιγάω in the imperative at Isa 32:5 is perhaps an attempt to interpret what was said in the context of the passage.


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b>   <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is found in parallelism with <span dir="rtl">נָדִיב</span>, ‘noble, generous’ (Isa 32:5), where <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is contrasted with the state of a <span dir="rtl">כִּילַי</span>, ‘villain’, and in parallelism with <span dir="rtl">שָׂרִים</span>, ‘officials’ (Job 34:19), where  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is contrasted with the state of the  <span dir="rtl">דַּל</span>, ‘poor’.


## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b> Isa 32:5 is part of a passage which promises a change in the behaviour and values of society when a king and his officials practice justice in government. No longer will those who act in an ungenerous and oppressive way (as 32:6-7 clarify the senses in which  <span dir="rtl">נָבָל</span> and the otherwise unattested  <span dir="rtl">כִּילַי</span> are being used here) be spoken of as <span dir="rtl">נָדִיב</span>, ‘noble, generous’, and  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span>. This seems to be meant as a contrast to the behaviour of present or previous kings and officials. In any case, <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is clearly a term of approbation, like <span dir="rtl">נָדִיב</span>, which is implied not to be deserved by those to whom it is currently being
applied. <span dir="rtl">נָדִיב</span>, which is much more frequent than <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span>, is used both of high social rank (e.g., 1 Sam 2:8) and, less often, of good character (Prov 17:7): the parallelism in Prov 19:6 suggests that generosity especially was meant. The description of the  <span dir="rtl">כִּילַי</span>, for whom  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is an inappropriate designation, in 32:7 points to characteristics of deceit and active exploitation of the poor rather than a lack of generosity, so that  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> seems to refer to a person who is truthful and does not take advantage of the weak to enlarge his own wealth, a person, that is, who lives according to accepted moral values. This would permit, like  <span dir="rtl">נָדִיב</span>, a normal application of <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> either to a person’s character or to his social status.


<b>A.2</b>  The context of Job 34:19 points conclusively to the ‘social’ interpretation of  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> (Fohrer 1989:463-66; cf. Joüon 1937:205-06). In
his challenge to Job’s questioning of God’s perfect justice Elihu cites the fact that God does not hesitate to denounce and condemn the high and mighty in human society (34:16-20): kings, leaders (<span dir="rtl">נָדִיב</span>), officials and the  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> (cf. also  <span dir="rtl">אַבִּיר</span> in 34:20). The point of the challenge is social standing and power, not moral probity, so both <span dir="rtl">נָדִיב</span> and  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> must be understood in this way here. Some (e.g., Dillmann, Driver and Gray, Pope, NRSV) translate  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> with ‘rich’ here, no doubt because of the association with  <span dir="rtl">דַּל</span>, but the latter is not decisive for the meaning of  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> in the context of the verse as a whole: the question of wealth is nowhere raised and power is what is at issue.  <span dir="rtl">דַּל</span> itself may mean ‘lowly’ or ‘weak’ as well as ‘poor’ (cf. Fabry 1978).

<span id="Con"></span>
## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>  In one of its two occurrences (Isa 32:5) <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> is a term of approbation and might be understood to designate either moral character or social status, but in the other (Job 34:19) social status is clearly meant. As a meaning which fits both passages the latter is to be preferred. It also corresponds to the closer of the two proposed cognates and to several of the versional renderings (Tg and Vg at Isa 32:5; LXX and Vg at Job 34:19: cf. also LXX at Ps 72(71):12; Job 29:12 [mistakenly] δυνάστου). ‘Great man’ would be an adequate translation. It follows that  <span dir="rtl">שׁוֹעַ</span> has no obvious connection with the root  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> (this is true even if it is regarded as meaning ‘generous’ in Isa 32:5; see 
<a href="#CRM">Root and Comparative Material A.1</a> above), and therefore it is not a member, even loosely, of the ‘deliverance’ word-group.
