## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Literal Use<a id="Lit"></a>

<b>A.1</b>
With the exception of 2 Kgs 4:10 and Zech 4:2, 11 <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span>, a derivative of the common Semitic √<i>nwr</i>/<i>nyr</i> (→ <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span>), and  a nominal form with the <span dir="rtl">מ</span>-preformative added to the verbal stem, is always used as a designation of the lampstand as a piece of the sanctuary’s furniture, either the Tabernacle (Exod 25:31-35 [7x]; 26:35; 30:27; 31:8; 35:14; 37:17-20 [6x]; 39:37; 40:4, 24; Lev 24:4; Num 3:31; 4:9; 8:2, 3, 4)  or the Temple of Solomon (1 Kgs 7:49; Jer 52:19; 1 Chron 28:15 [7x]; 2 Chron 4:7, 20; 13:11). In 2 Kgs 4:10 the lampstand is mentioned along with the bed, the table and the seat as one of the articles of furniture belonging to the inventory of the houses of the well-to-do in Israel. As a piece of the sanctuary’s furniture it is often mentioned 
together with other pieces of the sanctuary’s inventory, the ark, the table and the incense altar of the Tabernacle (Exod 30:26f.; 31:7f.; 35:12-15; 39:36-38; 40:3-5, 20-27; Num 3:31; 4:5-11; cf. also Exod 26:33-35), the table(s), the incense altar(s) of the Solomonic temple (1 Kgs 7:48f.; 1 Chron 28:15-18; 2 Chron 4:7f., 19f.). 

<b>A.2</b>
In Zech 4 the stand figures in a prophetic vision. Evidently a holy piece of 
furniture is meant. The lampstand is bearer of one or more oil lamps (→ <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span>; cf. Exod 25:37; 37:23; Zech 4:2). Lamps and lampstand belong together and are more often mentioned together (→ <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span>). So the stand can be designated as ‘the lampstand, the bearer of light’ (<span dir="rtl">הַמָּאֹור</span> <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרַת</span>  [Exod 35:14a; Num 4:9]; <a href=https://sahd-online.com/words/ma2or/ target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">מָאֹור</span></a>). In his blueprint of the new temple, Ezekiel (chs. 40-48) does mention neither the lampstand(s), nor the lamp(s). That does not change the fact that the lamp is to be regarded as an essential part of the furniture of the sanctuary. 

<b>A.3</b>
For the care of the stand and its lamps various utensils (<a href=https://sahd-online.com/words/kli/ target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">כְּלִי</span></a>) were available, further particularised as ‘containers of its oil’ (<span dir="rtl">שַׁמְנָהּ</span> <span dir="rtl">כְּלֵי</span>, Num 4:9; cf. Matt 25:3f.), ‘forceps, tongs’ (<a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mlqjym.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</a></span>), ‘firepans’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מַחְתָּה</span> plur.), ‘trimming knives, snuffers’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מְזַמֶּרֶת</span> plur.).

<b>A.4</b>
The Tabernacle had one lampstand. According to 2 Kgs 7:49 the first Temple had two rows of five lampstands (cf. 2 Chron 4:7; for the plural without number see Jer 52:19; 1 Chron 28:15; 2 Chron 4:20). In 2 Chron 13:11, in agreement with the situation described in Exod 25; 37 and that prevailing in the second Temple, there is only one lampstand. In the OT there is no information about the material of the lampstand as a piece of the furniture of a citizen’s house (2 Kgs 4:10). The Tabernacle and Temple lampstand(s) was/were made of gold (<span dir="rtl">זָהָב</span>, Jer 52:19; 1 Chron 28:15 [here also lampstands of silver (<span dir="rtl">כָּסֶף</span>) are mentioned]; 2 Chron 4:7; 13:11; cf. also Zech 4:2), further particularised as ‘of pure gold’ (<span dir="rtl">טָהֹור</span> <span dir="rtl">זָהָב</span>, Exod 25:31, 36; 37:12, 22), ‘of ‘‘closed’’ gold’ (<span dir="rtl">סָגוּר</span> <span dir="rtl">זָהָב</span>, 1 Kgs 7:49; 2 Chron 4:22; ‘closed’ means ‘soldered with silver’<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:17')">17</a></sup>), or ‘of hammered gold’ (<span dir="rtl">זָהָב</span> <span dir="rtl">מִקְשָׁה</span>, Num 8:4; cf. the use of <span dir="rtl">מִקְשָׁה</span> in Exod 25:31, 36; 37:17, 22). Consequently the lampstand of the Tabernacle can be described as ‘the bright/glittering lampstand’ (<span dir="rtl">הַטְּהֹרָה</span> <span dir="rtl">הַמְּנֹרָה</span>, Exod 31:8; 9:37; Lev 24:4). It is a disputed question whether the complete lampstand was made of gold. On the basis of an analysis of the term <span dir="rtl">מִקְשָׁה</span>, it is concluded that the Tabernacle lampstand was constructed by covering a wooden model with a layer of gold.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:18')">18</a></sup> The traditional view is that the entire object was made of gold. Already Josephus describes it as a hollow object of cast gold.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:19')">19</a></sup> Probably the stand was to be put together in parts, placing the ornaments at the spots where the parts were joined.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:20')">20</a></sup>

<b>A.5</b>
No measurements of the lampstand are given. In any case its height will have been in agreement with its function. It made for better light inside (cf. Matt 5:15 par.). Placing of more than one lamp on the stand increased the intensity of the light and its spread even more (cf. Zech 4:2, 49, burning wicks!). How the lights were placed affected how far and where their light would shine (cf. Exod 25:37; Num 8:2f.). The lampstand of the Tabernacle was to be placed in such a way that the light fell on the 
table (so explicitly the Vulgate on Num 8:2). Consequently it must have stood at a height higher than the table which had a height of a cubit and a half (Exod 25:33; 37:10). 

<b>A.6</b>
Only in Exod 25; 37; Zech 4 the shape of the lampstand is described. Although the description of the Tabernacle lampstand in Exod 25:31-36; 37:17-22 is fairly detailed, the difficulty in establishing the precise meaning of the vocabulary, derived from the plant kingdom (<span dir="rtl">יָרֵךְ</span>, ‘trunk’; → <span dir="rtl">קָנֶה</span>, ‘stalk’; → <span dir="rtl">גָּבִיעַ</span>, ‘cup’; <span dir="rtl">כַּפְתֹֹּור</span>, ‘calyx’; <span dir="rtl">פֶּּרַח</span>, ‘petal’; <span dir="rtl">מְשֻׁקָּּדִים</span>, ‘in the shape of almond blossoms’),  makes it impossible to obtain a complete picture.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:21')">21</a></sup>

<b>A.7</b>
On the basis of archeological data (the armless stand carries the lights on the saucer-like top [see <a href="#Arch">6.4 Archeology</a>]), and the assumption of a tradition which maintains that there was only one lamp in the tent shrine (see Exod 27:20; Lev 24:2 [<span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> sing.]), the view is defended that the central stalk (<span dir="rtl">קָנֶה</span> [Exod 25:31; 37:17]) of the lampstand was the lightbearer, the place where  the lampstand’s seven lights were situated, while the stalks (<span dir="rtl">קָנִים</span>) on the sides (Exod 25:32f., 35f.; 37:18f., 21f.) were without lights.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:22')">22</a></sup> Also in Zech 4:2 such a stand would be meant. Such an interpretation of the Tabernacle lampstand does not agree with the extant Hebrew text which supports a more traditional picture. According to another view, however, this picture is the outcome of a redactional adaptation of the basic text of Exod 25:31-40 (P<sup>G</sup>), which would have contained the concept of the lampstand of Zech 4, an armless stand carrying its lights on an saucer-like top.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:23')">23</a></sup> While accepting the view that the original stand was without arms, Görg draws a different picture based on the  lotus-shaped candelabrum in the grave of Tutanchamun (see <a href="#Arch">6.4 Archeology</a>).<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:24')">24</a></sup> Hachlili assumes that the early cultic menorah consisted solely of a lampstand. In her view the Tabernacle Menorah of Exodus is a retrojection of the Second Temple type menorah, the seven-armed menorah which originated in th time spane between the return of the Jews to Zion and the Hasmonean period.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:25')">25</a></sup>

<b>A.8</b>
In Exod 25:32; 37:18 the <span dir="rtl">קָנִים</span> are described as <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span> <span dir="rtl">קְנֵי</span> (lamp bearing stalks). The construct is probably intended to bring out that the branches support the main shaft as being the lampstand proper (Exod 25:31b; 37:17b) and also themselves carry lights. As is clear, ‘lampstand’ is used in Exod 25:31b, 33-35; 37:17b, 19-21 in 
a narrow sense as term for the ‘trunk’ and the ‘stalk’ arising from it. Elsewhere ‘lampstand’ is used in a broader sense for the entire object, with stalks and all (cf. Exod 25:31a; 37:17a; 26:35; 30:27; 31:8 etc.). Apparently the entire object is also in view in Exod 25:37-39; 37:23, 24.

<b>A.9</b>
Generally the lampstand of Zech 4:2, 11 is regarded as an armless stand carrying its seven lights (<span dir="rtl">נֵרֹות</span>) with their seven spouts (<span dir="rtl">מוּצָקֹות</span>) on a saucer-like top, a bowl (<a href=https://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/glh.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">גֻּלָּה</a></span>).<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:26')">26</a></sup> Sometimes the olive trees (<span dir="rtl">זֵיתִים</span>) of Zech 4:3, 11f. are interpreted as decorations on the bowl. No information is given on the shape of the lampstands of the temple of Solomon. Only one discutable element is mentioned: <span dir="rtl">הַפֶּּרַח</span> (1 Kgs 7:49; 2 Chron 4:20). It is interpreted as ornamental floral work or equated with the <span dir="rtl">גֻּלָּה</span> of Zech 4:2.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:27')">27</a></sup> Often the view is maintained that the lampstands in Solomon’s temple were stands without arms, shaped like the menorah in Zechariah’s vision.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:28')">28</a></sup> The following history of the cultic lampstand is assumed: the lampstands of Solomon’s temple were shaped like the stand of Zech 4; the second Temple had a stand with seven branches (cf. Exod 25; 37); it was replaced in 165 <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">bc</span> (cf. 1 Macc 1:21; 4:49f.) by the lampstand shown on the Arch of Titus.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:29')">29</a></sup> In any case, it is certain that the description of the lampstand in Exod 25; 37 has more in common with the <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span> on later depictions than with the reconstructed picture based on Zech 4:2.

<b>A.10</b>
Usually the Tabernacle lampstand is pictured as follows: the stalks, branches curving upward, protrude from both sides of the main stem; all end at the same height, that of 
the trunk (stalk in the center), so that the seven lights are on the same horizontal level.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:30')">30</a></sup> Such a picture is based on the illustration of the <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span> on the Arch of Titus and many later illustrations (see <a href="#Pic">6.3 Pictorial Material</a>). In view of the terminology for the <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span>, it seems, however, more likely that the envisioned shape of the stand was that of a stylised tree which makes one wonder whether a stand resembling a pine tree was intended:<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:31')">31</a></sup> from the stem, on either side, protrude straight stalks, which two by two end at <i>different</i> heights; the center stalk sticks out above and forms the top. Cf. the illustration of the <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span> from the synagogue of Dura Europos and see depictions of the tree of life on seals from Mesopotamia (see <a href="#Fig">6.2 Figurative Use</a> and <a href="#Pic">6.3 Pictorial Material</a>). Probably <span dir="rtl">יָרֵךְ</span> (Exod 25:31; 37:17) is a designation of the lampstand’s base, as it stands for the ‘lower end’, the part of the stand that is broad and heavy (‘the stem’, ‘the trunk’) which provides stability to the whole object.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:32')">32</a></sup>


### <a id="Fig"></a>6.2 Figurative Use

<b>A.1</b> 
In view of the form of the Tabernacle lampstand the question arises whether, in addition to its function as a bearer of lights, it may also have had a symbolic meaning. Was the stand with the lights more than just a source of light?

<b>A.2</b> 
Important to note is that the standard of Exod 25; 37 is described with terms derived from the plant kingdom. The picture evoked is that of a stylised tree (see <a href="#Lit">6.1 Literal Use</a>; this interpretation is contested by Hachlili<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:33')">33</a></sup>). The stylised tree, sometimes with seven branches and of the ‘spruce type’, occurs frequently on iconographic material from the ancient Near East,<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:34')">34</a></sup> and is regarded as a depiction of the tree of life, a symbol of fertility and life, associated with many deities.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:35')">35</a></sup> It is argued that as to its shape, the lampstand was based on the iconographically attested tree of life, and that as to its function it was primarily a ‘tree’ and secondarily a light holder, symbol of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span>’s approachability and powerful presence in the aniconic sanctuary. Based on philological, archeological and art-historical analysis of the <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span> of the Tabernacle, the conclusion is drawn that the lampstand dates from the end of the Late Bronze era or shortly after, so that it fits inside the Mosaic period.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:36')">36</a></sup> This interpretation is not convincing. In the Tabernacle the presence of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span> is closely linked with ‘the place of atonement’ (see Exod 25:22; Lev 16:2; Num 7:89). It is more likely that the lampstand, also by its shape, had to make it attractive to <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span> to reside in the sanctuary. Its beautiful form must make him favourably inclined toward his people. The shape of the tree might have been picked because the presence of the tree of life turns the sanctuary into a kind of paradise and also conveys the idea that the resident is the owner of the tree of life (Gen 2:9; 3:24). More weight, however, might be attached to the fact that the tree was a specific place where theophanies happened (Gen 12:6f.; 18:1; Judg 6:11, 19, and see also 2 Sam 5:24). That suggests the possibility that 
the form of a tree was chosen as an invitation to <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span> to manifest himself right there, in the 
sanctuary (cf. Gen 21:33). Besides, the symbolism associated with the tree makes it 
fitting that the lampstand, the primary function of which  is to spread light, should be in the form of a tree. After all, the life it symbolises owes its existence to light. The oil is its sap and the lights are its flowers and fruits. Light and 
life (vegetation) are closely related and can appear in one figure, that of the tree of light.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:37')">37</a></sup> An eventual special significance of  the almond blossom on the lampstand (see <a href="#Lit">6.1 Literal Use</a>) is hard to trace. Possibly it was more than a mere ornament. Noticeably, another object in the sanctuary, the staff of Aaron, had the same ornaments (Num 17:22-26; Heb 9:4).

<b>A.3</b> 
Whether the <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span> may be regarded as a relic of an earlier symbolic representation of Asherah in the form of a tree<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:38')">38</a></sup> whereas the stone tablets in or before the ark would be relics of the stelae of ancestor worship remains wholly uncertain. Such stones and trees are often associated in Canaanite inscriptions and are represented together on Tyrian coins,<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:39')">39</a></sup> but any direct connection with the <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span> is lacking thus far.

<b>A.4</b> 
Indisputably the lampstand of Zech 4 has a symbolic meaning. Opinions, however, differ with regard to this meaning.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:40')">40</a></sup> Some think it is a symbol of the community, others consider it to be a symbol of (the Temple mountain with) the new Temple (cf. Zech 4:7-9). Many regard the lampstand with the lights as a symbol of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span> (cf. Zech 4:10b, 14).<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:41')">41</a></sup>


### <a id="Pic"></a>6.3 Pictorial Material

<b>A.1</b> 
In attempts to reconstruct the shape of the lampstand of Exod 25; 37 and to describe its symbolic significance, the depictions of the tree of life on seals from Mesopotamia play an important role (see <a href="#Fig">6.2 Figurative Use</a>). It is likely that early pictures of the menorah, such as the one on a coin bearing the name of Mattathias Antigonus (40-37 <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">bce</span>),<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:42')">42</a></sup> on the Arch of Titus,<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:43')">43</a></sup> and in the synagogue of Dura Europos (3th century <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">bce</span><sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:44')">44</a></sup>), as well as the depictions of the seven-branched candelabrum which after the destruction of the second temple, from the beginning of the second century onwards, are frequently found in synagogues, on sarcophaguses, on amulets etc.,<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:45')">45</a></sup> all rest on interpretation of the postexilic biblical texts. The double, octagonal base of the menorah on the Arch of Titus has received a lot of attention, because it differs from the base on (later) depictions of the menorah and because the visible panels contain images of animals, eagles and (sea)monsters - loathsome images (cf. Ezek 8:10) - such as one would not expect to find in the temple. It is supposed that the picture on the triumphal arch is not a faithful reproduction.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:46')">46</a></sup> Also a matter of dispute is whether the menorah originally belonged to the furniture of the synagogue, and whether the synagogal menorah or the menorah of the second temple is the ‘Urbild’ of the depictions. Some contend that, despite a rabbinic prohibition to make a seven-branched lampstand<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:47')">47</a></sup> - the lampstand of the Hanukkah feast has eight arms - originally the furniture of the synagogue, 
and possibly that of the homes as well, included a seven-branched menorah, and that such a menorah, not the one of the temple and depicted on the triumphal Arch of Titus, provided the inspiration for the images.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:48')">48</a></sup> Others disagree.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:49')">49</a></sup> The discovery of the Menorah Treasure at the foot of the Temple Mount has thrown new light on these contested issues.

### <a id="Arch"></a>6.4 Archaeology

<b>A.1</b> 
Excavations have provided examples of what lampstands in the ancient Near East may have looked like. They were made of wood, clay, stone or metal. Not always it is
clear what their function was. For holding a censer, offerings, or one or more lamps? That at least some of them were used to hold lamps is certain, however. Stands came in a great variety: there were stands on legs; stands with a wide, round shaft, thicker 
at the bottom than at the top; stands with a small, downward thickening shaft that turns into a base; stands with a shaft gradually widening toward the bottom.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:51')">51</a></sup> In all instances it concerns stands without arms, leaving it uncertain whether they can be used for purposes of comparison. Attention has been drawn to an alabaster lamp (27cm high) from the tomb of Tutankhamen. The lamp is made from one block of stone, out of which extend a head and two side branches, each bearing a cup in the shape of a lotus flower.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:52')">52</a></sup>


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
The lampstand is an article of furniture which was used as a bearer of lamps both in  
the houses of the well-to-do and in the sanctuary. It could be fashioned from various materials, metal, wood and ceramic. Its height is in agreement with its function: 
servicing for better light inside a room. So it could rise higher than a normal human’s height. As appears from Exod 25:37 a lampstand could have the shape of a 
stylised tree and this, supported by iconography from the ancient Near East, has given rise to a lot of hypotheses about its symbolic meaning.
