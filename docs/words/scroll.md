##<span id="RCM">1. Root and Comparative Material</span>

<b>A.1</b> <i>Root</i>:  <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> is a derivative of the verb  √<span dir="rtl">גלל</span>, ‘to roll’. √<i>gll</i> is general Semitic (Cohen, <i>DRS</i>, 3:125-29; Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small>, 218) and has counterparts in Aramaic <span dir="rtl">גלל</span>, 
Akkadian <i>galālu</i>, ‘to roll’ (<i>AHw</i>, 273), 
and Ethiopic. The etymology of <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> is clear: it denotes something that can be rolled – a scroll on which to write. 

<b>A.2</b> <i>Loanword</i>: According to Hurvitz (1996), the Hebrew noun <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> is a late pre-exilic loan from Aramaic, but in view of its possible attestation in Phoenician this is an unnecessary assumption. For the sense development, Klein (<i>CEDHL</i>, 315) points to Latin <i>volumen</i>, ‘roll, book’, from <i>volvere</i>, ‘to roll’. 

<b>A.3</b> <i>Akkadian</i>: <i>magallatu</i>, ‘parchment scroll’, is found in Late Babylonian and is undoubtedly a loanword from Aramaic.[^1] 

<b>A.4</b> <i>Phoenician</i>: Arslan Tash 2 (7th cent. BCE) ends with the following words: <i>mnty kmglt</i> (rev. 7). The words were first interpreted as a short colophon meaning ‘my/his spell is in agreement with the scroll’ (Caquot 1971:405-06). However, the interpretation of <i>mglt</i> as ‘the scroll(s)’ is disputed (<i>DNWSI</i>, 593). 

<b>A.5</b> <i>Old and Imperial Aramaic</i>: <span dir="rtl">מגלה</span>, ‘scroll’, is probably also attested in Egyptian Aramaic (<i>ADE</i>, 210, but reading <span dir="rtl">מסלה</span> is possible). 

<b>A.6</b> <i>Postbiblical Hebrew</i>: The noun <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> is attested frequently in PBHeb; see <a href="#Exe-litA8">Exegesis: Textual Evidence A.8</a>.

<b>A.7</b> <i>Jewish Aramaic</i>: <span dir="rtl">מְגִילְּתָא</span>, <span dir="rtl">מְגַלְּתָא</span>, ‘scroll’;[^2] cf. <a href="#AVTg">Ancient Versions: Targum</a>, and see also Aram. <span dir="rtl">מגלה</span> in Ezra 6:2 and 4Q550 fr1:5.

<b>A.8</b> <i>Syriac</i>: For Syriac <span dir="rtl">ܡܓܠܐ</span> (<i>mgallā</i>) and <span dir="rtl">ܡܓܠܬܐ</span> (<i>mgalṯā</i>), ‘scroll’;[^3]
see <a href="#AVPesh">Ancient Versions: Peshitta</a>.

<b>A.9</b> <i>Mandaic</i>: <i>magalta</i> ‘scroll’ (<i>MD</i>, 238). 

<b>A.10</b> <i>Classical Arabic</i>: <i>maǧalla</i>, ‘book, volume, writing, written paper’ (Lane, 438), is probably a loanword from Aramaic (Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small>, 628).

##<span id="FC">2. Formal Characteristics</span>

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> (sg. st.abs.), <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת</span> (sg. st.cstr.). <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>  is a <i>ma/iqtil</i> form, derived from <span dir="rtl">גלל</span>, with a feminine termination (BL, 492 wζ; Meyer, <i>HG</i>, 34-35). 

##<span id="Syn">3. Syntagmatics</span>

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> is specified by the following adjectives:  

* <span dir="rtl">אַחֶרֶת</span>, ‘other’, Jer 36:28, 32;
* <span dir="rtl">זֹאת</span>, ‘this’, Jer 36:29; Ezek 3:1, 2, 3;
* <span dir="rtl">עָפָה</span>, ‘flying’ (part.act. of <span dir="rtl">עוף</span>, ‘to fly’), Zech 5:1, 2;
* <span dir="rtl">רִאשֹׁנָה</span>, ‘first’, Jer 36:28;
* <span dir="rtl">חֲדָה</span>, ‘one’ (BAram.), Ezra 6:2. 

<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> occurs as the subject of:

* <span dir="rtl">היה</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to be’, Ezek 3:3 (<span dir="rtl">וַתְּהִי</span>);
* <span dir="rtl">עוף</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to fly’; see  A.1 <span dir="rtl">עָפָה</span>. 

<b>A.3</b>  <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> occurs as the direct object of: 

* <span dir="rtl">אכל</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to eat’, Ezek 3:1, 3; <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to feed’, Ezek 3:2, 3; 
* <span dir="rtl">לקח</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to take’, Jer 36:2, 14<small><sup>1,2</sup></small>, 21, 28, 32; 
* <span dir="rtl">מלא</span> <i>piel</i>, ‘to fill’, Ezek 3:3;
* <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to give’, Jer 36:32; Ezek 3:3;
* <span dir="rtl">פקד</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to store’, Jer 36:20;
* <span dir="rtl">פרשׁ</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to spread out’, Ezek 2:10;
* <span dir="rtl">קרא</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to read’, Jer 36:21;
* <span dir="rtl">ראה</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to see’, Zech 5:2;
* <span dir="rtl"> שׂרף</span> <i>qal</i>,‘to burn’, Jer 36:25, 27, 28, 29;
* <span dir="rtl">שׁכח</span> <i>hithpeel</i> (BAram.), ‘to be found’, Ezra 6:2; 4Q550 fr1:5.

<b>A.4</b>
<span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> functions as <i>nomen regens</i> of: 

* <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>: <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span>, ‘scroll of a book’ (Jer 36:2, 4; Ezek 2:9; Ps 40:8). 

##<span id="AV">4. Ancient Versions</span>

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>: 

* δρέπανον,  ‘sickle’:[^4] Zech 5:1, 2;
* κεφαλὶς, ‘little head’ (dim. of κεφαλή),[^7] ‘rounded top end, scroll’:[^8] Ezek 2:9; 3:1, 2, 3; Ps 40:8 (LXX 39:8); Ezra 6:2;
* χάρτης, ‘papyrus roll’:[^5] Jer 36:23 (LXX 43:23);
* χαρτίον, ‘papyrus roll’ (dim. of χάρτης):[^6] Jer 36:2, 4, 6, 14<small><sup>1,2</sup></small>, 20, 21, 25, 27, 28<small><sup>1,2</sup></small>, 29, 32 (LXX 43:2, 4, etc.).

<b>A.1</b> In Jeremiah, LXX translates <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span> as χαρτίον βιβλίου, ‘a small roll of a book’ (36:2 = LXX 43:2), 
but <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> alone only by χαρτίον  (36:6 = LXX 43:6). 
In Ezek 2:9 and Ps 40:8 (LXX 39:8),
the Greek translators render <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span> 
as κεφαλὶς βιβλίου, ‘a scroll of a book’, 
but <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> alone in Ezek 3:1-3 and Ezra 6:2 as κεφαλὶς . 
The translators of Zech 5:1-2 opted for δρέπανον, ‘sickle’, which presupposes a different vocalisation (<span dir="rtl">מַגָּל</span>, ‘sickle’).


<b><span id="AVPesh">b. Peshitta (Pesh)</span></b>: 

* <span dir="rtl">ܟܪܟܐ</span> (<i>kerkā</i>), ‘book, volume, tome’:[^9] Ezek 2:9; 3:1, 2, 3;
* <span dir="rtl">ܡܓܠܬܐ</span> (<i>mgalṯā</i>), ‘scroll’:  Jer 36:2, 4, 6, 14<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></small>, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></small>, 29, 32; Zech 5:1, 2; Ezra 6:2 
(cf. Syriac under <a href="#RCM">Root and Comparative Material</a>);
* <span dir="rtl">ܪܝܫܐ</span> (<i>rīšā</i>), ‘head, top’:[^10] Ps 40:8, with 
<span dir="rtl">ܒܪܝܫ ܟܬ̈ܒܐ</span>, ‘in the head of the books’, as the translation of 
<span dir="rtl">בִּמְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span>.


<b><span id="AVTg">c. Targumim (Tg)</span></b>:

* <span dir="rtl">מְגִילְּתָא</span>, ‘scroll’: all cases. 
Cf. Jewish Aramaic under <a href="#RCM">Root and Comparative Material</a>.


<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>caput</i>, ‘head’: Ps 40:8 (Vg<small><sup>PsG</sup></small></small>), with <i>in capite libri</i>, ‘in the head of the book’, as the translation of <span dir="rtl">בִּמְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span>;
* <i>involutus</i>, ‘rolled up’ (from <i>involvere</i>, ‘to roll’):[^11] Ezek 2:9;
* <i>liber</i>, ‘a book written for publication, volume, roll’:[^12] Jer 36:25;
* <i>volumen</i>, ‘a roll of papyrus forming a book or part of a book, a roll of writing, a roll, book, volume’:[^13] Jer 36:2, 4, 6, 14<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></small>, 20, 21, 23, 27, 28<small><sup>1,2</sup></small>, 29, 32; Ezek 3:1, 2, 3; Zech 5:1, 2; Ps 40:8 (Vg<small><sup>PsH</sup></small>); Ezra 6:2.

<b>A.2</b> Vg translates <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span> as <i>volumen libri</i> in Jer 36:2, 4; Ps 40:8 (Vg<small><sup>PsH</sup></small>). 
In Ezek 2:9 this combination is translated as <i>involutus liber</i>, ‘a book rolled up’, 
with <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> rendered as an adjective. 
In Jer 36:25 <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> is rendered with a form of <i>liber</i>, 
perhaps because in Jer 36:23 <span dir="rtl">שָׁלֹשׁ דְּלָתֹות וְאַרְבָּעָה</span> is translated as <i>tres pagellas vel quattuor</i>, ‘three or four little pages’. 
The entire book could have been referred to as <i>liber</i> and the translation <i>volumen</i> was not chosen, because a roll does not contain pages.

<b>A.3</b> In Ps 40:8, the awkward renderings of <span dir="rtl">בִּמְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span> in 
Pesh and Vg<small><sup>PsG</sup></small> are due to the reading ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου in LXX.
Pesh and Vg<small><sup>PsG</sup></small> interpreted κεφαλὶς  as ‘(little) head’ (dim. of κεφαλή) instead of ‘scroll’.

##<span id="Exe">6. Exegesis</span>

###<span id="Exe-lit">6.1 Textual Evidence</span>

<b>A.1</b> 
The combination <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span>, ‘scroll of a book’, 
occurs four times (Jer 36:2, 4; Ezek 2:9; Ps 40:8).
The <i>nomen rectum</i> <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>, ‘book’, ‘document’, is used to disambiguate the function of the <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>:
it has been made for writing a large amount of text
(<span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>). 
After the expression <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span>, the same scroll could be designated more briefly as 
<span dir="rtl">הַמְּגִלָּה</span>, ‘the scroll’ (Jer 36:6, 14, 20, 21, etc.), or as <span dir="rtl">הַמְּגִלָּה הַזֹּאת</span>, ‘this scroll’
(Ezek 3:1, 2, 3),
or as <span dir="rtl">הַסֵּפֶר</span>, ‘the book’, ‘the document’ (Jer 36:8, 10, 11, 13, 18, 32). 

<b>A.2</b> 
From the twenty occurrences in the Nebiim, 
fourteen are found in Jeremiah 36, which is the 
major story about a <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> (cf. Hardmeier 2008). 
Even if this story should be seen as a postexilic polemic treatise (so Knobloch 2009), its factual description is useful. 
First, Jeremiah gets the instruction to take (√<span dir="rtl">לקח</span>) a <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span>  and to write down (√<span dir="rtl">כתב</span>) all the 
prophecies he had received from God until 
that day. The actual writing, however,  is done by Baruch (Jer 36:4). 
It is also Baruch who reads aloud (√<span dir="rtl">קרא</span>) the 
text in the temple, in the hearing of all the people (36:6, 8, 10, 13, 14). 
Having read the prophecies, Baruch is requested to come to the 
chamber of the scribes (36:20) and to read the words of Jeremiah again (36:14-19). 
In 36:20 the scroll is laid away (√<span dir="rtl">פקד</span> <i>hiph.</i>), but later it is 
fetched (√<span dir="rtl">לקח</span>) again (36:21). King 
Jehoiakim wants to hear its content, but as soon as 
three or four columns (<span dir="rtl">דֶּלֶת</span>), about one leaf of a scroll, have been 
read, he cuts off (√<span dir="rtl">קרע</span>) the section that has just been read
with a penknife or razor (<span dir="rtl">תַּעַר</span>) and casts 
(√<span dir="rtl">שׁלף</span> <i>hiph.</i>) it into the fire that was in a brazier (<span dir="rtl">אַח</span>). In 
this way, the whole <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> is consumed (√<span dir="rtl">תמם</span>) by 
the fire (36:23).
From the fact that King 
Jehoiakim burns (√<span dir="rtl">שׁלף</span>, 
36:25, 27, 28) 
Jeremiah’s scroll in the brazier inside the room in which he is residing we 
can conclude that the scroll was probably made from 
papyrus and not from leather (Lundbom 2004: 586-87).  In the end, 
God commands Jeremiah to take (√<span dir="rtl">לקח</span>) another <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>
and to write down (√<span dir="rtl">כתב</span>) the prophecies once 
again (36:28). Jeremiah complies, takes (√<span dir="rtl">לקח</span>) 
another <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>, and gives (√<span dir="rtl">נתן</span>) it to Baruch, who 
does the actual writing again (36:32).

<b>A.3</b> 
In Ezek 2:9-3:3, God presents a <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span> with 
lamentations 
written on the outside and the 
inside – an exceptional phenomenon – to the prophet with 
the command to eat (√<span dir="rtl">אכל</span>) it. Its taste proves to 
be like sweet honey (Ezek 3:3), but causes bitterness in the end (Ezek 3:14).  Since we are dealing with a visionary experience, 
it is useless to speculate about the question whether the scroll was made from
either leather or papyrus. 

<b>A.4</b> Zech 5:1-2 refers to the appearance of a
<span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה עָפָה</span>, ‘flying scroll’, during a vision. Also in this case, it is unclear of which material the scroll was made. A few more characteristics of the <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> are revealed in the following verses. The scroll has huge dimensions, almost 10 by 5 meters: <span dir="rtl"> אָרְכָּהּ עֶשְׂרִים בָּאַמָּה וְרָחְבָּהּ עֶשֶׂר בָּאַמָּה</span>, ‘its length twenty cubits and its width ten cubits’ (5:2).
This exceptional size presupposes a leather scroll rather than one made of papyrus. The scroll is said to represent an <span dir="rtl">אָלָה</span>, ‘oath’, having two sides, both times indicated with the Hebrew <span dir="rtl">מִזֶּה</span> (Zech 5:3). It acts as an avenger for God, consuming the houses of thieves and persons who swear falsely (Zech 5:3-4).

<b>A.5</b> In Ps 40:8 we read: <span dir="rtl">אָז אָמַרְתִּי הִנֵּה בָאתִי בִּמְגִלַּת סֵ֝פֶר כָּתוּב עָלָי</span>, ‘Then I said: See, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written about me’. The expression <span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת סֵפֶר</span>  seems to indicate the same heavenly scroll which is called <span dir="rtl">סִפְרָה</span>  in Ps 56:9 and <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>  in Exod 32:32-33.

<b>A.6</b> 
Ezra 6:2: <span dir="rtl">וְהִשְׁתְּכַח בְּאַחְמְתָא בְּבִירְתָא דִּי בְּמָדַי מְדִינְתָּה מְגִלָּה חֲדָה וְכֵן כְּתִיב בְּגַוַּהּ דִּכְרוֹנָה׃</span>,
‘then was found in Achmetha in the fortress in the province Media a certain scroll; and this was written in it as a record: ...’     
\[Discussion will be added later.]

<b>A.7</b> 4Q550 fr1:4-5:
<span dir="rtl">שבעה בעזקתה די דריוש</span> [<span dir="rtl">ן</span>]<span dir="rtl">מה חתמי֗</span>[<span dir="rtl">דה חתי</span>]<span dir="rtl">ובין ספריא אשתכח מגלה ח</span>,
‘and among the documents was found a cer[tain] scroll [sea]led with seven stamp[s] by the signet-ring of Darius’ (DJD XXXVII, 12-16). 
\[Discussion will be added later.]

<span id="Exe-litA8"><b>A.8</b></span> In Rabbinic and later Hebrew,  <span dir="rtl">הַמְּגִלָּה</span>, ‘the scroll’, is the common designation of the Book of Esther. The plural form <span dir="rtl">מְגִלֹּות</span>, ‘scrolls’, ‘Megilloth’, is used for the five books Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Qohelet, and Esther, 
each of which is read during one of the Jewish religious festivals. Because of this special use, these books were sometimes bundled separately.

###<span id="Exe-ar">6.3 Archaeology</span>

<b>A.1</b> 
In Egypt papyrus scrolls were used since the Old Kingdom (<i>AALA</i>, 534-35). Up to twenty sheets of papyrus or leather could be joined to form a scroll (<i>AEMT</i>, 236-38; Tov 2004, 36-43). In the case of the brittle papyrus, the sheets were joined with glue; in the case of leather with threads, mostly sinews. The overall length of the great Isaiah scroll from Qumran (1QIsa<small><sup>a</sup></small>), for example, is 7.34 meters, 
divided over 17 sheets of uneven widths. 
In biblical scholarship it is sometimes stated that up to the second century BCE only papyrus scrolls were used. In Egypt, however, parchment was used since the eighteenth dynasty (<i>AEMT</i>, 303) and it is quite likely that this material was introduced in Palestine already in the premonarchic period. Neither papyrus nor leather withstood the Palestinian climate well, with its wet winters, so that thus far scrolls have only been discovered in the dry Judaean Desert. 


##<span id="Con">7. Conclusion</span>

<b>A.1</b> The word <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span> has a narrower meaning than the word <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>. It designates a scroll made of papyrus or leather on which literary texts were written, such as prophecies or lamentations.
