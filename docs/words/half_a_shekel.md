**A.1**  Many weights inscribed with the word בקעhave been found;² whereas
one weight was found with only the בand one with probably the letters
קע(letters not clear on the photograph).[^33] See furthermore section 6.4.
Archaeology.

## 1. Root and Comparative Material

**A.1**  The word בֶַּקַעis derived from בקע, ‘to cleave’, ‘to split’,⁴ which
has, next to בֶַּקַע, a few derivatives: *בְּקִיַעַ, ‘breach’, ‘rubble’, and
בִּקְָעָה, ‘valley’. The latter word is applied in a number of locative or
topographical names: בִּקְעַת אֶָוֶן(Amos 1:5);

(Deut 34:3), etc. בִּקְעַת יְֵרֵחבֿ

**A.2**  The noun בֶַּקַעis not attested in the cognate languages.⁵ However,
the root בקע is attested in, for example, Ug. bqʿ, ‘to split, open’,⁶
Moab. bqʿ, ‘to break through (of dawn)’,⁷ LMHebr. בקע, ‘to split,
chop’.⁸

בֶַּקַעA.3 The BHebr. word, ‘weight, coin’, is used in a quotation from Exod
38:26 ⁹in the midrashim, such as Bereshit Rabba (84:18):

אַוֶֹם מְכַרְוֶֹם בְּנָהּ שֶׁל רָחֵל בְּעֶשְִׂרִים כֶָּסֶף, לְפִיכָךְ יִהְיֶה כָּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד מַגִּיעבֿ בֶּקַע
לַגֻּלְגֶֹּלֶת, הֲדָא הוּא דִכְִתִיב (שמות לח, כו): בֶּקַע לַגֻּלְגֶֹּלֶת .מַחֲצִית הַשֶֶּׁקֶל,

‘You sold Rachel’s son for twenty pieces of silver, therefore shall
each of you bring a beka a head; thus it is written (Exod 38:26): A
beka a head, half a shekel.’¹⁰

## 2. Formal Characteristics

**A.1**  בֶַּקַעis a qatl formation – the most common formation of nouns
(almost a quarter of all nouns)¹¹ – of the root tertiae gutturalis
^(√)בקע.¹²

## 3. Syntagmatics

**A.1**  In the Hebrew Bible בֶַּקַעoccurs twice in singular absolute, whereas
no other forms are attested. In epigraphical sources the word is
solely applied as the designation of the weight on which it was
inscribed.

**A.2**  בֶַּקַעoccurs in a nominal clause: בֶּקַע מִשְָׁקָלבֿ, ‘a beka is its weight’,
Gen 24:22;

וְכֶסֶף צְּקוּדֵי הָעֵָדָה … בֶּקַע לַגֻּלְגֶֹּלֶת, ‘the silver of the counted ones of the
congregation was

… a beka per head’, Exod 38:25–26.¹³

**A.3**  בֶַּקַעoccurs in apposition: בֶַּקַע … מַחֲצִית הַשֶֶּׁקֶל, ‘a beka … half a
shekel’, Exod 38:26.¹⁴

Ancient Versions

**a.**  Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions:

δραχμὴ, ‘drachm (a weight)’:¹⁵ Gen 24:22^(lxx); Exod 39:3^(lxx)
(38:26^(mt)); δίδραχμον, ‘coin of two drachmas, half shekel’:¹⁶ Exod
39:3^(αʹ) (38:26^(mt)).

**b.**  Targumin (T):

דַּרְְכְּמבֿן, ‘drachma’:¹⁷ Gen 24:22 (T^(PsJ)); Exod 38:26 (T^(PsJ)).

טבי, ‘half-shekel’:¹⁸ Gen 24:22 (T^(Smr)); Exod 38:26 (T^(Smr)).

טֶַבַע, ‘coin’:¹⁹ Gen 24:22 (T^(N)); Exod 38:26 (T^(N)).

וִֹקְָלָא, ‘shekel’:²⁰ Gen 24:22 (T^(O)); Exod 38:26 (T^(O)).

**c.**  Peshitta (S):

¾Ćàøÿâ (maṯqālā), ‘weight, scale, shekel’:²¹ Gen 24:22; Exod 38:26.

בֶַּקַעbeka (half a shekel) 3

**d.**  Vulgate (V)

siclos duos, ‘two shekel’:²² Gen 24:22. No equivalent: Exod 38:26.²³

Lexical/Semantic Fields

**A.1**  בֶַּקַעoccurs in the context of the description of the weight of gold
(זָָהָב, Gen 24:22) and silver (כֶֶּסֶף, Exod 38:25–26). Another weight
mentioned in its direct context is the shekel (→ שֶֶׁקֶל). The beka is
even equated with a half shekel in Exod 38:26. This use seems to agree
with the custom of expressing the worth of precious goods in terms of
weight, whereas an amount of food was described on the basis of its
size or volume.²⁴

Exegesis

**6.1**  Literal Use

**A.1**  The word בֶַּקַעhas the basic meaning ‘split off’, ‘piece’, ‘part’,²⁵
and in Exod 38:26 it is a ‘part’ (from two parts) of a shekel.²⁶

**A.2**  The designation בֶַּקַעis mentioned as a weight in Gen 24:22: Abraham’s
servant gives rich gifts to Rebeccah. He takes (לקח) a golden ring (נֶזֶם
זָָהָב), whose weight (מִשְָׁקָל) is a בֶַּקַע, as well as two bracelets, which have
ten golden shekels (עֲשָׂרָה זָָהָב; cf. → שֶֶׁקֶל) as their weight. The use ofbeka
weighs only a portion of a shekel. בֶַּקַעfor a ring, next to ‘ten shekels’
for bracelets, suggests that a a beka weighs only a portion of a shekel.

**A.3**  In Exod 38:26 a בֶַּקַעis mentioned in the context of the mention of
silver (כֶֶּסֶף, Exod 38:25) belonging to the processed materials (Exod
38:24-31) in the manufacture of the tabernacle and was gathered in a
census. This is referred to as a בֶַּקַעin silver a head for every one who
was numbered in the census from the age of twenty years old and
upwards. A בֶַּקַעis further referred to in 38:26 as half a shekel (מַ
חֲִצִיתהַשֶֶּׁקֶל, ‘half of a shekel’) ‘by the sanctuary shekel’ (שֶֶׁקֶל → ,בְּשֶׁקֶל
הַרֶֹּדֶֹשׁ).

**6.2**  Figurative Use Not attested.

**6.3**  Pictorial Material

**A.1**  Some pictures or drawings of beka weights have been published in
the literature on the subject.²⁷ Two of these are presented below
(figs. 1 and 2), of which the round, stone weight is the most usual
exemplar of this weight.

**A.2**  A First Temple period beka weight was discovered during the
sifting project of archaeological soil originating from the Western
Wall foundations in the Emek Tzurim National Park under auspices of
the City of David Foundation. The finding is interesting, because the
weight was inscribed in mirror script (see Fig.1, below), which
suggests that the craftsman was used to create seals and to write in
mirror

script.³⁰

**6.4**  Archaeology

**A.1**  Kletter mentions thirty-five weights designated with the letters ק
,ב, and ע(or two or one of these letters) as a בֶַּקַע.³² Their provenance
is, as far as it is known, for the most part in Judah, they date from
the late 8th century BCE, and later centuries and vary according to
its calculation in weight from 5.51 to about 6.90 grams, with an
average of 6,003 grams.³³ These weights, all homogeneous in shape, are
as a rule made of stone as all weights were,³⁴ although a metal weight
is found as well.³⁵ It is also possible to point out a number of
uninscribed beka weights (6.0-6.6 grams, mostly of stone), of which it
is difficult to say whether they date from the same or an earlier
period.³⁶

בֶַּקַעbeka (half a shekel) 5

Conclusion

**A.1**  The בֶַּקַע, ’half shekel’, is part of a weight system that is based
on the שֶֶׁקֶל. The fact that the found beka weights vary in weight is
attributed to the existence of more than one weight standard.³⁷
However, it can also be explained by factors such as mistakes in the
manufacture of the weights, inability to accurately weigh, wear and
tamper.³⁸ Since the found beka weights originate from the same time
and, as far as is known, come largely from the same area (Judaea) and
are largely homogeneous in terms of material and shape, it is probable
that these weights are of the same weight standard.³⁹ It is therefore
very likely that the same weight standard is to be applied to the
בֶַּקַעof Gen 24:22 and the one of Exod 38:26. It is true that for the
בֶַּקַעof Exod 38:26, unlike that of Gen 24:22, the standard of the
‘sanctuary shekel’ applies. But the question is whether this is a
standard set by the sanctuary that would deviate from that which is
used in the normal use of the shekel (see → שֶֶׁקֶל).

Heltzer 1998: 44*-46*, argues for 6.82gr as the weight of a Judaean
half-shekel, whereas most studies assume the average weight in line
with Kletter’s observations. In this respect the comment by Marvin
Powell (Powell 1992: 905) should be kept inmind: ‘Most surviving
weight specimens are small and deviation from a given norm increases
as the size of the weight decreases.’ Similarly Weippert 1977: 93.
