<b>A.1</b> 
The occurrence in Ezek 28:12 is based upon an emendation defended by a host of scholars with reference to the versions; 
cf. the discussion in <a href="#Exe-fig">Figurative Use A.1</a>.


## 1. Root and Comparative Material
<span id="RCM"></span>

<b>A.1</b> <i>Root</i>:
 Since the root is attested in both Northwest and South Semitic languages (<i>CDG</i>, 267-8, 297-98, 785), a Semitic origin might be considered, but is unlikely. See below.


<b>A.2</b> <i>Egyptian</i>: Many scholars
regard <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> as an Egyptian loanword (<i>ḫtm</i>, cf. 
<i>WSP</i>, 135).[^a1] This is a credible hypothesis because the Egyptian word occurs in texts 
dating from the Old Kingdom and still denotes the cylinder seal there (Schott 1957:181), not 
the stamp seal that became predominant in Canaan. So the Egyptian word dates from a time long 
before the Semitic influence in Egypt became significant. Moreover, in Akkadian a totally different 
word (<i>kunukku</i>) was used.

<b>A.3</b> <i>Akkadian</i>: Hallo (1983:7), takes the Akkadian term <i>kunukku</i> (seal, sealed tablet)
as the equivalent of Hebrew
<span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> since it is equated
with the Eblaite <i>ḫu-tá-mu</i> in a lexical
text from Ebla. This <i>kunukku</i> mostly designates a cylinder seal. It occurs in a Babylonian passage 
that renders as follows, ‘My son, if it be the wish of the prince that you are
his, if you hang his closely guarded (<i>na-aṣ-ra-am-ma</i>) seal around (your neck), 
open his treasure house, enter within, for apart from you
there is no one else (who may do this)’ (Lambert 1960:130, l.82; cf. <i>CAD</i> K, 544a-b). This text illustrates the special privileges of a man wearing the seal of someone else. The word
<i>kunukku</i> is provided with the determinative for ‘stone’.

<b>A.4</b> <i>Ugaritic</i>: In broken context <i>KTU</i> 2.25 has <i>ḫtm . rb</i>. It is unclear whether this means ‘a big seal’ or is a PN followed by <i>rb</i> ‘officer’.

<b>A.5</b> <i>Phoenician, Punic</i>: <i>ḥtm</i>, occurs as  ‘seal’, and as a verb ‘to seal’ (<i>DNWSI</i> 413-14). A third meaning might be ‘signet officer (?)’, ‘sealer(?)’, or ‘maker of seals(?)’ (cf. Heb. <span dir="rtl">חוֹתֵם</span>).

<b>A.6</b> <i>Old and Imperial Aramaic</i>: <i>ḥtm</i> occurs as a noun ‘seal’ and as a verb ‘to seal’ (<i>DNWSI</i>, 414; <i>ADE</i>, 141). 

<b>A.7</b> <i>Postbiblical Hebrew</i>: See <a href="#Exe-lit">Exegesis: Textual Evidence A.4</a>.

<b>A.8</b> <i>Jewish Aramaic</i>: For Qumran, see <a href="#Exe-lit">Exegesis: Textual Evidence A.4</a>. 
The verb <span dir="rtl">חתם</span> occurs both in Palestinian and Babylonian Jewish Aramaic in the sense of ‘to seal, sign, validate’. Furthermore are found <span dir="rtl">חתום</span> ‘signatory, engraver’; <span dir="rtl">חתמא</span> / <span dir="rtl">חתמתא</span> ‘seal, sealing, validation’; <span dir="rtl">חתמותא</span> ‘sealing, signature’ (Sokoloff, <i>DJPA</i>, 218; Sokoloff, <i>DJBA</i>, 489-90). 


<b>A.9</b> <i>Samaritan Aramaic</i>: Both the verb and the noun do occur, the former also in the figurative sense of ‘to finish’. <span dir="rtl">חתמא</span> is attested in the metaphorical sense of ‘completion, end’ (cf. Tal, <i>DSA</i>, 300-01).

<b>A.10</b> <i>Syriac</i>: The root <span dir="rtl">ܚܬܡ</span> (<i>ḥtm</i>) and many derivatives are attested, not only in the meaning of ‘seal’, but also ‘finish, end’ and in the specialised meaning 
of ‘making the sign of the cross’ (Payne Smith, 
<i>CSD</i>, 164; <i>LSyr</i>, 264).

<b>A.11</b> <i>Old Arabic</i>: The verb <i>ḫtm</i> ‘to seal’ occurs in Qatabian (<i>LIQ</i>, 76).

<b>A.12</b> <i>Classical Arabic</i>: Attested as <i>ḫatm</i>, <i>ḫātam</i>, possibly borrowed from Aramaic (so Fraenkel 1886:252; <i>CEDHL</i>, 212).

<b>A.13</b> <i>Modern South Arabic</i>: Mehri, <i>ḫōtem</i> ‘ring’ (<i>ML</i>, 451); Soqotri <i>ḫātem</i>, ‘seal’ (<i>LSoq</i>, 197).

<b>A.14</b> <i>Ethiopic</i>: <i>ḫatama</i> ‘to seal’, <i>māḫtam</i>, <i>maḫtamt</i>, ‘stamp seal, sign’ and many other derivations (cf. <i>CDG</i>, 267-8, 297-8).

## 2. Formal Characteristics</span>

<b>A.1</b> Albeit <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> might be seen as an Egyptian loanword, it is in <i>qoṭel</i> form 
and as such seems to point to a substantive character based on the root <span dir="rtl">חתם</span>.[^a2] 

<span id="Syn">
## 3. Syntagmatics</span>


<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> is <i>nomen rectum</i> of:

* <span dir="rtl">פתוח</span>, ‘engraving’, Exod 28:11, 21, 36; 39:6, 14, 30; Sir 45:11<small><sup>B</sup></small>; 4Q365 f12biii:13;
* <span dir="rtl">חֹמר</span>, ‘clay’, Job 38:14;


Adverb
* <span dir="rtl">צר</span>, ‘narrow’, Job 41:7;<br>

* <span dir="rtl">ברקת</span>, ‘morning star’ or ‘jewel’, Sir 32:6<small><sup>B,F</sup></small>; 
* <span dir="rtl">חזון</span>, ‘appearance’, 4Q300 f1aii-b:2.



<span dir="rtl">חֹתֶמֶת</span> is <i>object</i> of:

* <span dir="rtl">מִי</span>, ‘who’, Gen 37:25;
* <span dir="rtl">ישׁ</span>, ‘there is’, 4Q274 f3ii:3.



<span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> is conjoined with the verbs: 

* <span dir="rtl">נתן</span>, ‘to give’, Gen 38:18; 4Q364 f9a-b:7; 
* <span dir="rtl">חתם</span>, ‘to seal’, 1 Kgs 21:8; 4Q300 f1aii-b:2; 
* <span dir="rtl">היה</span>, ‘to be’, Jer 22:24; 
* <span dir="rtl">שׂים</span>, ‘to place’, Hag 2:23; Song 8:6 (2x); 
* <span dir="rtl">בושׁ</span>, ‘to be ashamed’, Sir 42:6<small><sup>Mass,B</sup></small>.



<span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> is governed by:

* <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, ‘in’, 1 Kgs 21:8;
* <span dir="rtl">כְּ</span>, ‘like’, Hag 2:23; Song 8:6 (2x); Sir 32:5<small><sup>B,F</sup></small>.

<b>A.2</b> 
The Massoretes have noted that <span dir="rtl">כחוֹתָם</span> is found only thrice in HB: in Hag 2:23 and Song 8:6 (2x) (<i>BHQ</i> 13:48\*).

<b>A.3</b> 
PAM43686 f37:1 is impossible to analyse due to the state of the fragment.

<b>B.1</b> For Sir 42:6 the verb is found in v. 1 (<span dir="rtl">בושׁ</span>, ‘to be ashamed’), but for MS Mass, the reconstuction of Reymond (http://www.bensira.org) presents <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> as subject of <span dir="rtl">ש֗ת</span>, translated as: ‘[he] wields’.

<b>A.1</b> 
In the Targumim the words <span dir="rtl">פִּתּוּחֵי חֹתָם</span> are treated in various ways. The word <span dir="rtl">חֹתָם</span> is translated with the cognate only in the glosses of Tg<small><sup>N</sup></small> in Exod 28:11, 21 (<span dir="rtl">גלף דחתום</span>); 39:6 (<span dir="rtl">גלף דחתים</span>); Exod 39:14, 30 (<span dir="rtl">גליף דחתים</span>).The other Targumim employ the following rendering of <span dir="rtl">פִּתּוּחֵי חֹתָם</span>: 
<span dir="rtl">כתב מפרש כגלף דעזקא</span> in Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> Exod 28:11, 21; 39:14; <span dir="rtl">גליף חקיק ומפרש הי כגלוף דעיזקא</span> in Tg<small><sup>PsJ</sup></small> Exod 28:11, 21; 39:14; <span dir="rtl">גליף חקיק </span> in Tg<small><sup>N</sup></small> 28:11, 21, 36; 39:6, 14, 30. In Exod 39:6 Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> has <span dir="rtl">גליפן כתב מפרש</span>, while in Exod 28:36 and 39:30 Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> have <span dir="rtl">כתב מפרש</span>; in Exod 39:6 Tg<small><sup>PsJ</sup></small> has <span dir="rtl">גליפן כתב חקיק מפרש</span>, in Exod 39:30 <span dir="rtl">גליף חקיק ומפרש</span>, and in Exod 28:36 <span dir="rtl">חקיק ומפרש</span>.


<b>A.2</b>
The words <span dir="rtl">כְתָב מְפָרַש</span> ‘the script is <to be> distinct’ might be seen as a later insertion to explain the words <span dir="rtl">כִגלָף דְעִזקָא</span>, ‘like the engraving of a signet’. This explanation is offered for Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> Exod 28:11 (cf. Grossfeld 1988:79, n. 3). These words combined with <span dir="rtl">כִגלָף דְעִזקָא</span> are also found in Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> Exod 28:11, 21; 39:14, and Tg<small><sup>PsJ</sup></small> Exod 28:11  21; 39:14. But without in Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> Exod 28:36; 39:6, 30; Tg<small><sup>PsJ</sup></small> Exod 39:6.

<b>A.3</b> In LXX the expression <span dir="rtl">פִּתּוּחֵי חֹתָם</span> is translated differently, Exod 28:11 γλύμμα σφραγῖδος, ‘engraved figure, inscription’;[^30] 28:21 γλύφαὶ σφραγίδων, ‘carved work, carving, engraving’;[^31] 28:36 ἐκτύπωμα σφραγῖδος, ‘figure in relief’;[^32] 39:6 (LXX 36:13) ἐκκόλαμμα σφραγῖδος, ‘anything engraven’;[^33] 39:14 (LXX 36:21) 
ἐγγεγραμμένα εἰς σφραγῖδος, ‘to write down, to inscribe’;[^34] 39:30 (LXX 36:37) ἐκτετυπωμένα σφραγῖδος, ‘to model or work in relief’.[^35]   
According to the Greek text of the Wisdom of Ben Sira the most precious kind of a signet was an amber seal (σφραγἰς) on a precious stone (Sir 32:5 [35:7]) and an emerald seal in a golden setting (Sir 32:5 [35:7]). Sir 38:27 describes the craftsmen that made the signet ring, he who engraves
seals, always thinking of good likeliness. A seal was used to lock things up, as it is said in Sir 42:6, ‘With an evil wife, it is as well to use a seal (σφραγἰς), and where there are many hands, lock things up’ (on the Hebrew text, see <a href="#Exe-lit">Exegesis: Textual Evidence A.4</a>). 
A few times the word σφραγἰς  is used figuratively: Sir 17:22 compares almsgiving to a signet ring for YHWH, and parallels it with the apple of the eye. In Sir 22:27 it is asked ‘Who will set a guard on my mouth, and an efficient seal (σφραγἰς) on my lips, to keep me from falling, and my tongue from causing my ruin?’ 



<b>A.4</b> The cord in Gen 38:18 becomes a ‘cloak’ (<span dir="rtl">שושיפא</span>) in Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> and the Palestinian Targums. In Exod 28:11, 21; 39:14 both Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> and Tg<small><sup>PsJ</sup></small> 
stipulate that the lettering should be clearly readable, like ‘the engraving on a ring’. 
The same rendering, <span dir="rtl">עזקתא</span>, is chosen in 1 Kgs 21:8; Jer 22:24; Hag 2:23; Song 8:6 (2x), probably to specify that we are dealing with a signet ring. 

<b>A.5</b> The translation of Gen 38:18 in Pesh betrays the influence of a Targumic tradition: <span dir="rtl">ܥܙܩܬܐ ܘܫܘܫܦܟ</span> (<i>ʿezqtā wšošpāk</i>), ‘your ring and your cloak’. In Job 38:14 the translator interpreted the consonants <span dir="rtl">חותם</span> as ‘their bodies’ and in Job 41:15 he rendered freely ‘sealed’.

<b>A.6</b> SP always has the rendering <span dir="rtl">חתים</span>.

<b>A.7</b> According to Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1272, the word <span dir="rtl">צוּרְתָא</span> in Tg Ezek 28:12 is a Hebraism; cf. the Hebrew (<span dir="rtl">צוּרה</span>).

###6.1 Textual Evidence
<span id="Exe-lit"></span>


<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> is found rendered as ‘seal, signet ring’ (BDB, 368; <i>DCH</i> iii:180),  ‘Siegel, Siegelring’ (Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small>, 333; <i>HAL</i>, 288, 350; <i>ThWAT</i>, vol. 3, 282-8, esp. 288), ‘sigillum ... anulus signatorius’ (Zorell, 229), and Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 538: ‘sigillum ... Quoniam lapis signatorius plerumque annulo inclusus erat, <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> annulum signatorium significat, et propterea de re, quae in summo pretio habetur’; or only as ‘seal’/‘Siegel’ (<i>HAWAT</i>, 102: ‘Siegel, ... metaph. unveräusserliches Kleinod’); KBL, 284; <i>NIDOTTE</i>, vol. 2, 324-25) or only  ‘Siegelring’ (<i>HCHAT</i>, vol. 1, 386).  <i>MHH</i>, 283 explains it as <span dir="rtl">מכשיר שסינש לחתימה ונישא על יד ימין או על הצוואר</span>,<span dir="rtl">חותמת</span> ‘A device that is pressed for signing and is carried on the right hand or on the neck’, as does <i>TLB</i>, 3:103: ‘Seal, signet ring worn on right hand or upon the neck ... perhaps connected with thread. Served as sign of individual identification ... Fig.: symbol of expensive and chosen thing’. <i>DBHE</i>, 236 has the rendering of ‘seal’ but adds also ‘padlock’, ‘bolt’, and sees it as a methonym for ‘signet ring’:  ‘sello, timbre, cuño; candado, cerrejo. Por metonimia, el anillo del sello’.

<b>A.2</b> A seal <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> was engraved (<span dir="rtl">פתח</span>, literally ‘opened’) in (semi-)precious stone (cf. Exod 28:9) or glass by a specialised jeweller (<span dir="rtl">חָרַשׁ</span>). Since most people were unable to write, the seal served as a tool for authentication. As such it is one of the most frequently found relics of the cultures of the ancient Near East and it is simply impossible to review all that has been written about seals and sealing in antiquity here. 

Documents on papyrus or leather were sealed with a bulla of clay identifying the sender (→ <span dir="rtl">אִגֶּרֶת</span>, <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>; cf. 1 Kgs 21:8; Job 38:14). Unfortunately the papyrus mostly decayed, but the clay with the seal impression remained. This is what is called a <i>bulla</i> (plural <i>bullae</i>). Literally thousands of such <i>bullae</i> have been found in Israel. The Hebrew word <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> could denote either the instrument with which the impression was made or the <i>bulla</i> which carried the impression. A seal could be applied to a scroll to prevent people from reading it prematurely (Isa 8:16; 29:11; Dan 12:4, 9, 24). 
In the Aramaic so-called Proto-Esther 4Q550:5 a scroll (→ <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>)
of king Darius is mentioned which was presumably ‘sealed with seven seals of his ring’. In the Book of Revelation too a scroll with seven seals is mentioned (Rev 5:1, 5).

But not only documents were authenticated by means of a seal. Jars with oil or wine were sealed to identify their owner. Just as in Mesopotamia and Egypt (cf. <i>CAD</i> (K), 548; Arnaud 2007:157, ll. 75-6; Schott 1957:180-82), a seal could be used to prevent unauthorised entry of a storehouse (Deut 32:34). 

In order to guarantee authenticity, each seal had to have a unique decoration, even though the motifs were often copied from other seals. In many cases the jeweller also added the name and/or title of the owner (cf. Exod 28:11; 39:6, 14, 30), or his pedigree, and finally enclosed the seal in a gold or silver bezel. One such ring appears to be partially preserved (Deutsch 2003:72-74), but many seal impressions show a groove around the impression indicating the presence of a ring. In Jer 22:24 the <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> stands <i>pars pro toto</i> for the signet ring. However, not all seals were stamp seals and even stamp seals were not always embedded in a ring.


Despite Exod 20:4, many seals and bullae from ancient Israel were adorned with drawings of human beings, mythological animals (e.g. sphinxes), plants and trees, just as in the surrounding countries. Sometimes traditional Egyptian religious symbols are present, even on seals purportedly executed for Judaean kings (see e.g. Schroer 1987; Keel & Uehlinger 1992; Deutsch 2003). It is unwarranted to play down this evidence as mere symbols of power, without any religious significance (so, e.g., Deutsch 
2002:51). But their presence certainly testifies to Phoenician-Egyptian superiority with regard to the manufacture of jewelry, as does the fact that both Hebrew designations of the seal, <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> and → <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span>, are old Egyptian loan words. Despite the mythological elements there is insuffficient reason to assume the meaning ‘seal-amulet’ (Loretz 2004:257-58).


Since there existed two types of seal, the cylinder seal and the stamp seal, it seemed logical to differentiate between these two words in biblical Hebrew. Moscati, 
for example, regarded <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> as a general term for seal which might also include the cylinder seal, whereas <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> would have been the exclusive term for the stamp seal. However, there is no compelling reason to assume a typological difference between the two Hebrew words. Probably both denoted the signet-ring in general, in Palestine mostly the signet-ring or stamp seal which was the common type of seal there. Since <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> occurs in late texts only, it is possible that this word started to supersede <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> as a general term for the signet-ring in later Biblical Hebrew. The circumstance that <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> still denotes a signet-ring in the late text Hag 2:23 can be explained by the intended allusion to Jer 22:24. Exod 28:11, 21, 36; 39:6, 14, 30 create the impression that by the time of their composition <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> was reserved for the gemstone whereas <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> that occurs in the same chapters denoted any ring-shaped object. 


In Gen 38:18 Tamar asks for Judah’s <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> and its cord (→ <span dir="rtl">פָּתִיל</span>) as well as his walking stick (→ <span dir="rtl">מַטֶּה</span>). 
Hallo 1983:14, takes the ‘staff’ as the pin on which a
cylinder seal was mounted, but this is an unnecessary assumption. Both the seal and the staff were items of a highly personal nature and both were often inscribed with the name of the owner. In v. 25 the same seal is called <span dir="rtl">חֹתֶמֶת</span>, evidently nothing but a variant form of the same word (contrast <i>HAL</i>, 288: ‘Siegel’; 350: ‘Siegelring’). The cord suggested to Moscati that <span dir="rtl">חֹתֶמֶת</span>/<span dir="rtl">חֹותָם</span> must have been the cylinder seal here because it was apparently perforated and worn on a cord around the neck (Moscati 1949:316-7). Indeed it was possible to make an imprint from a cylinder seal holding the ends of a cord tightly drawn through the hole bored lenghtwise in the cylinder (Schott 1957:177). However, Keel (1984:144-47), followed by Schroer (1987:408-09), challenges this view and defends the stamp seal because archaeology has shown stamp seals to be far more common in ancient Israel than cylinder seals
(ratio 20:1). Stamp seals too could be worn attached to a cord through a perforation or to a knob (see below, section 8). <i>DCH</i> iii:180, suggests that in Gen 38:18 the expression
<span dir="rtl">בְּיָדֶךָ</span> not only relates to the staff, but also to the seal. In that case a cylinder seal worn on the wrist could be meant, but in view of the fact that the combination of <span dir="rtl">מַטֶּה</span> and <span dir="rtl">בְּיַד</span> is very common in biblical Hebrew, this is a less likely solution. 

Because the flat,
scaraboid or tabloid seals were often made of (semi-)precious stones and needed a ring or pendant of silver or gold as a setting, these
seals must have been relatively expensive. Consequently, only people in
high positions could afford this kind of seal. However, as we have seen, conoid stamp
seals and even thick scaraboid seals could be attached to a string too and this type of seal occurs so frequently in Palestine that it must have been within reach of less affluent people (Keel 1984:
117, with n. 440; Schroer 1987:404-06). Even though in Egyptian
the word <i>ḫtm</i> originally seems to have designated the cylinder seal (so Schott 1957:181), in contrast to <i>ḏbʿt</i>, (= Hebr. → <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span>,
the signet <i>ring</i>), this etymological argument is insufficient to prove that <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> in biblical Hebrew was still the cylinder seal. It seems more likely that <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> developed into a more or less general term for all types of seals (see above on Jer 22:24).

The use of a <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> is described in 1 Kgs 21:8. Jezebel writes letters in Ahab’s
name and seals them with his seal. This text illustrates the power a person acquired through using the seal of someone with higher authority. If Jezebel actually had her own seal, as seems very likely now (see Marsman 2003:655-65; Korpel 2006; 2008), she intended to assume Ahab’s authority. Comparable is Aḥiqar 3:18, where
Nadan writes a letter to the king of Egypt and seals it with the
signet ring (<i>ʿizqâ</i>) of his uncle Aḥiqar, pretending that Aḥiqar
himself had written the letter. Such acts may seem fraudulous to us and probably the writers of these passages intended to create this impression. In actual fact, however, dynastic seals could be used during many generations by different people (Auerbach 1991) and borrowing of seals might occur with the owner’s permission (cf. Gen 41:42; Est 8:7-10; Singer 1995:57-64).
Nevertheless, it must be assumed that normally nobody could use another person’s seal 
without explicit authorisation.


The passages in which the verb <span dir="rtl">חתם</span> <i>qal</i> or passive <i>qal</i> occurs show that the seal was used to lend authority not only to letters, but also to a
contract (Jer 32:10) or a covenant (Neh 9:38; 10:1). Also a scroll
<span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span> could be sealed (Isa 8:16; 29:11; Dan 12:4, 9,
//<span dir="rtl">סתם הַדְּבָרִים</span> ‘to shut up the words’) as well as a
vision <span dir="rtl">חָזוֹן</span> in the form of a written text (Dan 9:24). In these cases sealing was apparently used to prevent people from reading the contents before a predetermined time. 



<b>A.3</b> 
In Arad two orders for a jar of oil end with the instruction <span dir="rtl">חתם בחתמך</span> ‘and seal it with your seal’ (Arad [6] 13:3 and [6] 17:6-7, see also Arad [6] 4:2; [6] 7:9; [6] 10:4, where only the verb is used). The sealing in this context has the meaning of closing something safely, indicating the legal owner until it was delivered (cf. <i>HI</i>, 19).
Because bullae on jar handles always represent an imprint of a circular, scaraboid or tabloid seal, the word <span dir="rtl">חתם</span> can only refer to the (seal on a) signet ring or stamp here, not to a cylinder seal.

<b>A.4</b> The literal meaning of <span dir="rtl">חותם</span> seems to be attested in Sir 42:6 <span dir="rtl">על אשה רעה חותם חכם</span> ‘(Do not be ashamed of) an evil (var. foolish) wife (using) the seal of a wise man’.


In Sir 32:5-6 [35:5–6] <span dir="rtl">חותם</span> is used as a simile/metaphor for something very precious: <span dir="rtl">כחותם על כיס זהב שיר אל על משתה היין</span> ‘Like a seal on a bag of gold is a 
 with a banquet with wine’, <span dir="rtl">מלואות פז וחותם ברקת קול מזמור על נועם תירוש</span> ‘A setting of pure gold and a signet of carnelian is the sound of music with pleasant wine’.

The noun <span dir="rtl">חותם</span> occurs metaphorically in Qumran 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> XVI:11 <span dir="rtl">חותם רזו</span> ‘the seal of its mystery’ and 4Q300, fr. 1, ii:2 <span dir="rtl">כי חתום מכם ח]תם החזון</span> ‘because the seal of the vision is sealed up from you’. In a different metaphorical way it is used in 4Q274:fr. 3, ii.3: <span dir="rtl">וכול אשר יש לו חותם</span> ‘and everything that has a pod’. In the Aramaic so-called Proto-Esther 4Q550:5 a scroll of king Darius is mentioned which was presumably ‘sealed with seven seals of his ring’ (<span dir="rtl">חתימין שבעה בעזקתה</span>).

The circumstance that seals were often adorned with all kinds of animals and sometimes even pagan deities is assumed to have been embarrassing to Jews in the Talmudic period (<i>TA</i>, 1:200-01, 661). A kind of seal around the neck served to identify the owner of a slave (<i>TA</i>, 2:89) and sealings on jars were still common (<i>TA</i>, 2:279), as were seals to keep written documents secret and authenticate them (<i>TA</i>, 3:193-94).

<span id="Exe-fig"></span>
### 6.2 Figurative Use


<b>A.1</b> The seal is used as a prime example of artistic skill in the case of the breastplate of Aaron. When the stones have to be engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel the
craftsmen have to do their work just like an experienced stone carver engraving a seal (<span dir="rtl">פִּתּוּחֵ֣י חֹתָם</span>, Exod 28:11/
39:6, 14). It is interesting that the stones have to be enframed (<span dir="rtl">סבב</span> <i>hoph.</i>.) in gold filigree (<span dir="rtl">מִשְׁבְּצֹות זָהָב</span>), just as was done with seals in signet rings. According to Exod 28:36 (| 39:30) a plate of pure gold has to be
made for the turban of the priest and has to be inscribed with the words ‘Holy to YHWH’, again like the
engraving of a signet (<span dir="rtl">פִּתּוּחֵ֣י חֹתָם</span>). Sir 45:11-12 undoubtedly alludes to these Exodus texts. 

A signet ring was a precious and very personal object that was worn constantly, because it could be used for fraudulous transactions if it was lost or stolen (Hallo 1977 and 1983). This is the reason why seals were always kept in close contact to the skin. This occurs as a metaphor in Song 8:6 where one of the lovers asks the beloved, ‘put me (<span dir="rtl">שׂים</span> <i>qal</i>) like a seal upon your heart (<span dir="rtl">עַל־לִבֶּךָ</span>), as a seal upon your arm (<span dir="rtl">זְרֹועֶךָ</span>)’. In the first line <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span> can only be a seal attached to a cord or chain worn directly on the skin. The second seal is positioned <span dir="rtl">עַל־זְרֹועֶךָ</span> ‘on the arm’ which might be interpreted as ‘on the wrist’.[^36] It seems
fairly certain that the simile of the seal was introduced 
into the song to warn the other party of the fierce jealousy which would be 
the consequence of infidelity. The unbreakable bond of love may have been expressed by such a formula in which bride and groom promised each other absolute faithfulness and which may have been symbolised by a pair of similar seals or rings (cf. Lemaire 2007:14-5). In the textual tradition the formula has been transmitted as pronounced by either bride or groom (cf. Korpel 2003:97-103). 

Because the seal was such a precious and intimate object it became also an obvious choice for a personal name, comparable to ‘Ruby’ in modern times (Hotham in 1 Chron 7:32 and 1 Chron 11:44). 

A royal seal was a symbol of ultimate authority and therefore it is highly suggestive imagery when the prophet Haggai makes
Zerubbabel the signet ring on the hand of God, ‘I will take you, O Zerubbabel
my servant, the son of Shealtiel, and make (lit. ‘put’, <span dir="rtl">שׂים</span> <i>qal</i>, here perhaps preferable in view of Jer 22:24) you
like a signet ring; for I have chosen you’ (Hag 2:23). This imagery clearly implies that God will make Zerubbabel instrumental in all his decisions with regard to the overthrowing of the kingdoms described in Hag 2:22. The author of Sir 49:11 is still awed by this high distinction when he exclaims,
‘How shall we extol Zerubbabel? He was like a signet ring (σφραγίς) on
the right hand’, 
obviously referring back to Haggai’s prophecy.
Actually this prophecy was a conscious reversal of the punishment incurred by Zerubbabel’s grandfather Jehoiachin (Jeconiah, Coniah): ‘As surely as I live, even if you ... were a signet ring on my 
right hand, I would still pull (<span dir="rtl">נתק</span> <i>qal</i>) you off.’ (Jer 22:24). This text shows that a signet ring was usually worn on the right hand. This is confirmed by an Egyptian picture of a wesir wearing a cylindrical seal ring at his
right hand (Keel 1986:246, Abb. 142a). 

Ezek 28:12-13 (with the emendation adopted by the versions and a host of scholars, e.g. Zimmerli 1979:672) seems to
compare the King of Tyre to ‘a perfect signet (<span dir="rtl">חֹותֵם תָּכְנִית</span>, LXX ἀποσφράγισμα ὁμοιώσεως, ‘a signet of likeness’) full of wisdom and perfect in beauty’ (for a different solution see Callender 2000). The rare word <span dir="rtl">תָּכְנִית</span> is no doubt the same word as Akkadian <i>taknītu</i> / <i>taknû</i> ‘care, solicitude’ (<i>CAD</i> (T), 84-5), also used of carefully worked gems. So the literal meaning is ‘a signet of care’. The next verse enumerates many precious stones (see on the problematic identification of the gems Block 1997:106-10) which may have been thought to have been set in a pectoral or other ornament, but may also have been intended as material for the signet:‘every precious
stone was your covering (<span dir="rtl">מְסֻכָת</span>), the sardius, topaz, and the diamond (?), the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and
the carbuncle, and gold: the craftsmen work of your beauties (<span dir="rtl">תֻּפֶּיךָ</span>) and your engravings (<span dir="rtl">נְקָבֶיךָ</span>) were on you;
on the day you were created they were prepared’. The word <span dir="rtl">תֺּף</span> does not mean ‘tambourine’ here, but might be related to Ug.
<i>tp</i> ‘beauty’ (cf. <i>KTU</i> 1.96:2), as a parallel of <span dir="rtl">יֹפִי</span> in v. 12. Signets of kings often not only contained inscriptions,
to which the word <span dir="rtl">נֶקֶב</span> refers (derived from the root <span dir="rtl">נקב</span> ‘to perforate, to inscribe with a name’, cf. <i>KTU</i>
1.17:V.35), but also iconography (cf. Deutsch 2002). Probably the plural <span dir="rtl">תֻּפַּיִךְ</span> may describe the manifold engraved pictures on the seal. 
Because signet rings as well as cylinder seals could be inscribed (<i>ThWAT</i>,
vol. 3, 283; <i>LÄ</i>, vol. 5, 295) and set in gold (Hallo 1983:11-2; Schroer 1987:n. 277) 
 both kinds of seals might be meant in this text. Hallo 1983:14, favours
the cylinder seal because it is ‘durative’, it ends only where the impressed
surface ends. Thus, it would be a symbol of perfection. Up till now, however,
this metaphorical interpretation is not attested anywhere else in the ancient Near
East and cylinder seals were more common in Mesopotamia than in Syria and Palestine. 


In Job 38:14 God’s daily power over the dark is compared to the printing of a seal. There is no reason at all to assume the meaning ‘press mold’ here (contra 
<i>CVOT</i>, 10). The earth molds itself like clay (<span dir="rtl">חֹמֶר</span>) to the seal, when the rays of dawn slowly reveal the countours of
the earth: mountains, trees, people, animals; just as a flat surface of clay gets its wonderful shadowlines by the imprint of a seal. The rising sun with its beams
creating light and shadow is depicted as a garment over the earth. Keel 1984:114, with n. 426 (see also Schroer 1987:409) pays attention to the flow of
light in this simile: just as dawn does not illuminate any particular part of the earth at once but in a slow process, so the contours of the earth are revealed gradually. The beams of light ‘roll’ over the
surface of the earth as a cylinder seal rolls over the clay. This text would therefore prove that the cylinder seal and its use were known in ancient Israel.  

The image of sealing evoked the image of closing something tightly. In Job 41:17 (tr. 15), the back of the sea monster Leviathan is said to be made of rows of shields,
shut (<span dir="rtl">סגר</span> <i>qal</i>.pass.) by a tight (<span dir="rtl">צָר</span>) seal. The verb <span dir="rtl">חתם</span> <i>qal</i> often has this meaning of ‘to close’. In Job 9:7 YHWH speaks to the sun and it does not
shine anymore; he seals off (<span dir="rtl">חתם</span> <i>qal</i>) the light of the stars. Job 24:16 describes evildoers as people who shut themselves up in their dark
houses. For comparable use of the verb, see Lev 15:3; Song 4:12; Job 14:17 (‘a sealed bag’, <span dir="rtl">צְרֹור</span>). In Deut 32:34 God’s punishment is metaphorically stored up under seal (cf. Sanders 1996:226-28).

### 6.4 Archaeology
</span>

<b>A.1</b> Three main types of seal were used in the ancient Near East, the 
cylinder seal which made an impression in clay or wax by rolling, a
stamp seal, usually in the form of a ring, or a conoid stamp seal. All cylinder
seals discovered in Palestine were imported from Syria and Mesopotamia, or were local imitations (Schroer
1987:405, n. 263). The cylinder seal was pierced lengthwise to pull a cord or
wire through and 
was worn around the neck or a bracelet on the wrist (Shubert 2001:253).
However, also the conoid stamp seal could be worn on a cord. 
Sometimes even the
seal of a signet ring was perforated and worn on a wire. An expensive form of
this kind of seal was presented by Deutsch 2003, 72-4. In the reported
case the flat seal was set in a silver pendant and fixed with a wire passing
through a perforation. Other seals, however, also could be worn on a cord (Keel
1984:114, with n. 426). Several conic seals found in Palestine/Israel appear to
be perforated in the middle, like a button, in other cases the conic handle was
pierced crosswise (Keel-Leu 1989:1-39; Keel 1989:39-54). According to Kaplony 1984:291, 
the cylinder seal was at first predominant in ancient
Egypt, and was replaced by the signet ring only later on (in Palestine in the 1st millennium BCE, cf. Schott 1957:181; Schroer 1987:405, n. 263).


Although hoards of bullae nowadays often enough are reason to express doubt about 
their authenticity, it may be assumed that in many cases fire or decay has destroyed 
archives of papyrus, so that only the bullae remained <i>in situ</i> (cf. <i>LBI</i>, 307).


Up till now 24 Hebrew seals and bullae have been discovered which must have belonged to women, and another eight which might have belonged to women – a dwindling proportion of the thousands of seals and bullae found in Palestine/Israel
(Marsman 2003:643-58; Deutsch 2011:92). These seals throw light on the 
social status of Israelite women, indicating that in spite of their prevalent 
discrimination, they sometimes did have the 
legal right to sign documents. Of a woman named Shelomit, probably a high
official of the governor of Judah, it is likely that she worked as an
administrator because her seal (6th cent. BCE) was found in an 
official archive together with the seal of the province of Yehud (Marsman 2003:
653). A nice ring of a woman with a name seal in it is described by Deutsch
2003:72-4. The seal was made of glass and set in a silver ring. The signet ring 
(unfortunately without official finding place) was acquired together with five identical bullae, 
confirming the use of the signet ring, presumably in antiquity. A big and exceptionally 
beautiful seal may have belonged to the Israelite queen Jezebel and another one to a hitherto 
unknown queen Eldalah (Korpel 2006). 


Most seals were made of soft stone, enstatite (Magnesium Silicate) for example, which 
lent itself to easy engraving and was afterwards hardened in fire. More expensive
were stones of agate, cornelian, opal and sapphire. Often the choice of stone was related 
to the imagery engraved in it (Keel 1990:87-8; Lehmann 2002).


Noteworthy in the seals found in Palestine is the fact that the earliest and
oldest ones only present primitive symbols (dots, stars, etc.), and much later
pictures of animals and people, but from the 7th and 6th all such iconography on
seals seems to have disappeared. From that period on, seals generally
have two lines of lettering, often  inscriptions with names and titles. It is assumed that this could be related to the reformation of King Hezekiah and his emphasis on the aniconic character of the worship of YHWH (Keel 1977:44, with n. 74; Schroer 1987:405), but it is difficult to prove this.

Some signet rings have been found in pairs and may have functioned as wedding rings, in two sizes, both with the same iconography on the seal. Only the larger signet ring of the man was inscribed with his name and pedigree (see above on Song 8:6).

At the beginning of the 20th century Gustav Dalman reports that signet rings were made of silver and gold, and both were worn at the left hand as well as in a small bag, closed with a cord, around the neck (Dalman 1937:275).


<span id="Con">
## 7. Conclusion
</span>

<b>A.1</b> Biblical as well as extra-biblical evidence indicate that in Israelite historical times
 <span dir="rtl">חֹתֶמֶת / חוֹתָם</span> denoted the seal in general. The Egyptian origin of the word warrants the hypothesis that at least originally it may also have described a cylinder seal, but there is no definite proof for this in the Bible. In any case the verb <span dir="rtl">חתם</span> must be regarded as denominative of the noun <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span>. Especially the use of the
word in Song 8:6 supposes a general word ‘seal’, because two different kinds of
seal are designated with 
the same word <span dir="rtl">חוֹתָם</span>. As a personal object it could have
been both the cylinder seal as well as the signet ring (Keel 1986:245). 

<b>A.2</b> A seal was mostly worn by people in a position of authority, but had become common enough to be worn by ordinary people too. Because in the quasi-total absence of literacy the seal served as a means to identify its owner, it was jealously guarded. It must have been a token of ultimate trust when a king or officer allowed another person to borrow his seal. 


<b>A.3</b> The seal itself was made of stone that could easily be engraved. Many irrefutable examples show that despite the commandment to avoid graven images many people in ancient Israel and Judah did not see any harm in depicting human beings, mythological animals and Egyptian religious symbols on their seals. The engraved sealing stone was often
set into a ring of silver or gold, but could also be worn attached to a simple cord threaded through a perforation or tied around a knob. The way in which seals were worn could
vary. Three manners are attested in the biblical texts: attached to a cord around the
neck (Gen 38:18, 25), as a signet ring on the hand (Jer 22:24), or on the
wrist (Song 8:6). The seals were used to lend authority to a written text (1 Kgs
21:8) and to identify a person (Gen 38:25), especially the owner. The use of the verb <span dir="rtl">חתם</span> reveals that
seals were often used to secure closed objects like jars, bags or other
containers, to garantuee the integrity of their contents. They were also used to seal off storerooms or to protect documents from being read by people who did not have permission to do so. This metaphorical use of the word made it an ideal term to indicate that knowledge of certain mysteries had been ‘sealed off’.


<b>A.4</b> The ancient versions seem to confirm that the translators were aware of the fact that normally the ancient Israelite seal had the shape of a ring. Circular or oval impressions of seals on bullae confirm that the seal itself was usually set in a ring.
Because most seals found in Palestine/Israel are stamp seals and only rarely cylinder seals it must be concluded that in general the stamp seal was most common in the ancient region of Israel and Judah. The archaeological evidence from Palestine,
Egypt and Mesopotamia suggests that around the beginning of the first millennium the
cylinder seal was replaced by the stamp seal. From the archaeological evidence
it can be concluded that despite the gender discrimination in the ancient Orient, both men and women could use signet rings to authorise legal transactions
(<i>pace</i> MacKay 2000, who follows several older exegetes).
