## Introduction  

Grammatical Type: noun masc.  
Occurrences: 1x HB (0/1/0); 2x Qum; 0x Sir; 0x inscr. (Total: 3).

* Nebiim: Isa 65:4;
* Qumran: 4Q385 f2 5-6; 4Q386 f1 i:5;
* Text doubtful: –


<b>A.1</b>  The two Qumran documents are both texts of 4Q Pseudo-Ezekiel and
overlap where  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> occurs, enabling more of the total context to be seen.
Only the first occurrence of  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is extant in 4Q385, but the second can
be confidently restored by comparison with 4Q386.

<span id="QK"></span>

### Qere/Ketiv 

In Isa 65:4  <span dir="rtl">ופרק</span> is the Ketiv, but the Qere is  <span dir="rtl">ומרק</span> and this
is also the reading of 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>). 
<span dir="rtl">מָרַק</span> denotes broth (Judg 6:19-20;
see further below on Versions and
Exegesis). <i>BHS</i> retains the Ketiv, but the better attested Qere
(‘broth’) is followed in many modern translations (Luther, AV, RV, RSV,
NEB, REB, NRSV, NIV; but not JB, ‘food’), as well as by BDB, 830. As
a <i>hapax legomenon</i> in BH, however, the Ketiv is the more difficult
reading and should perhaps be preferred. See further below, <a href="#ExB1">Exegesis B.1</a>. 

## 1. Root And Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> See

and
<a href="/words/pereq/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>.


## 2. Formal Characteristics

*<span dir="rtl">פָּרָק</span> is a noun, presumed <i>qatal</i>-type (only construct form 
<span dir="rtl">פְרַק</span>
survives in a vocalised text of Ancient Hebrew).

## 3. Syntagmatics


<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is the subject of  <span dir="rtl">קרב</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘come near’, in 4Q385 f2 5 (though
the reading of the verb is somewhat uncertain and probably based on Ezek 37:7).


<b>A.2</b>  In Isa 65:4K  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is in the construct state before  <span dir="rtl">פגלים</span>,‘uncleanness’ (a genitive of the attribute, as in  <span dir="rtl">בשׂר פגול</span> in Ezek 4:14).


<b>A.3</b>   <span dir="rtl">פרק פגלים</span> (Isa 65:4K) is the subject of a noun-clause, in which the
complement is  <span dir="rtl">כליהם</span>, presumably ‘<i>in</i> their vessels’ (adverbial indication of place). The sg. here might well be collective.


<b>A.4</b>   <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> occurs in a composite expression  <span dir="rtl">פרק אׄל פרקו</span>, ‘one joint (shall come near) to another’ (4Q386 f1 i:5), which indicates that a  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> here forms part of a larger whole (though prior separation is also presupposed).

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>:

* ζωμός (θυσιῶν), ‘soup (of sacrifices)’: Isa 65:4.

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܛܘܫ</span> (<i>ṭwš</i>) <i>pael</i>, ‘to soil, profane’: Isa 65:4, with <span dir="rtl">ܘܡ݁ܛܘܫܝܢ ܒܫ̈ܠܕܐ ܡܐ̈ܢܝܗܘܢ</span> ,
‘profaning with corpses their things’,
as the rendering of <span dir="rtl">וּפְ/מְרַק פִּגֻּלִ֖ים כְּלֵיהֶֽם</span>.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: J)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">רְטַף</span>/<span dir="rtl">רְטַב</span>, ‘juice, broth’:<sup id="fnref:av1"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:av1')">av1</a></sup> Isa 65:4.

[^av1]: Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1471.



<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>ius</i>, ‘broth’: Isa 65:4, with
<i>et ius profanum in vasis eorum</i>, 
‘and profane broth in their vessels’,
as the rendering of <span dir="rtl">וּפְ/מְרַק פִּגֻּלִ֖ים כְּלֵיהֶֽם</span>.


<b>A.1</b>  LXX, Vg and Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small> render by words meaning ‘broth, soup’ and are
clearly based on the Qere  <span dir="rtl">ומרק</span> (see <a href="#QK">Qere/Ketiv</a>). LXX adds the
interpretive gloss θυσιῶν, ‘(made from) sacrifices’ and apparently (mis)understood  <span dir="rtl">פגלים</span> as a pass.part. <i>qal</i> of a verb <span dir="rtl">פגל</span> which occurs only in later Heb. and Aram. (Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1133), hence rendering it
by μεμολυμμένα, ‘defiled’. Since the verb  <span dir="rtl">פגל</span> and the associated nouns are used in MHeb. and Aram. specifically of invalid sacrifices, this (mis)understanding could also have given rise to the addition of θυσιῶν (cf. Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small>). In any case Vg avoids any such specific connection.


<b>A.2</b>  The Peshitta has no reference to soup or broth and may therefore have been endeavouring to render the Ketiv. But, apart from its use of 
<span dir="rtl">ܡܐ̈ܢܝܗܘܢ</span> (<i>mʾnyhwn</i>), ‘their things’, for  <span dir="rtl">כליהם</span>, its choice of equivalents (‘profaning’, 
if <span dir="rtl">ܡ݁ܛܘܫܝܢ</span> [<i>mṭwšyn</i>]
is from <span dir="rtl">ܛܘܫ</span> [<i>ṭwš</i>], and ‘with corpses’ [presumably reading  <span dir="rtl">פגרים</span> for  <span dir="rtl">פגלים</span>]) is
imprecise and probably based on guesswork inspired by a quest for a
suitable parallel to ‘eating pig’s flesh’ in the previous stich (for the
idea, cf. Num 19:14-15). There is no obvious etymological explanation for
Pesh's understanding of <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> (or  <span dir="rtl">מרק</span>) as meaning ‘profaning’. It is of
course possible that it got it from LXX’s μεμολυμμένα, not realizing
that this was intended as the equivalent of <span dir="rtl">פגלים</span> rather than
<span dir="rtl">פרק</span>/<span dir="rtl">מ</span>, in
which case the rendering is of no relevance to the semantics of  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>.

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields


<b>A.1</b>  In Isa 65:4 the parallel stich refers to the eating of ‘pig’s flesh’
(<span dir="rtl">בשׂר החזיר</span>), a forbidden dietary practice according to Lev 11:7-8 and
Deut 14:8.


<b>A.2</b>  Other materials which are said to be ‘in vessels’ (with  <span dir="rtl">ב</span>) are <span dir="rtl">חטאת</span>, ‘meat’
(Lev 6:21), a  <span dir="rtl">מנחה</span> (Num 4:16; Isa 66:20), ingredients for making
bread (Ezek 4:9),  <span dir="rtl">קיץ</span> (Jer 40:10), incense (Num 4:16), a mixture of
solids and liquids (Gen 43:11, but the sense of  <span dir="rtl">כלים</span> may be ‘baggage’),
water (Num 5:17 [<span dir="rtl">מים קדשׁים</span>]; 1 Kgs 17:10), wine (Est 1:7; Jer 40:10),
oil (Num 4:10; Jer 40:10). The list thus covers both solids and liquids, mainly but not entirely for human consumption, and items for use in both domestic and cultic situations (examples of  <span dir="rtl">כלי</span> preceded by <span dir="rtl">ב</span> where it
has a different sense are not included).

<b>A.3</b>  In 4Q385 f2 the expression
<span dir="rtl">פרק אׄל פרקו</span> 
is preceded by
<span dir="rtl">עצם אל עצםו</span>,
‘one bone to another’, which (with the wider context and its basis in
Ezek 37, where  <span dir="rtl">עצם אל עצםו</span> occurs in v. 7) suggests that a  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is
something like an  <span dir="rtl">עצם</span> but not identical to it. The order of the
expressions might be taken to mean that a  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is something smaller than
an  <span dir="rtl">עצם</span>, which would also fit with both etymology and usage outside
Ancient Hebrew.

## 6. Exegesis


<b>A.1</b> Karl Marti (1900:401-02) and Wim Beuken (1989:67) leave open the possibility that <span dir="rtl">פָּרָק</span> is the original reading in Isa 65:4, rendering
it ‘Brocken’ (‘crumbs’, pres. ‘small pieces’ [sc. of meat]) or ‘brokken’ (pres. the same). Both of them, like other commentators, interpret the
consumption of this food as part of secret rituals, perhaps connected
with the cult of the dead.

<span id="ExA2"><b>A.2</b></span> 
In 4Q385 and 4Q386 the context seems to require a reference to bones
without flesh on them, and the placement after
<span dir="rtl">עצם</span> 
(cf. Syntagmatics)
points to ‘smaller bones, joints’ being meant. This fits a use of  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> in later Heb. (see <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>: Root and Etymology A.5), to which there are
possible parallels in Syriac (cf. ibid., A.7). The BHeb. word  <span dir="rtl">מפרקת</span> (q.v.),
‘neck(-bone)’, may also be connected with this, in view of the
neck-bone’s composition from several small bones
(vertebrae).
The vocalisation of the Qumran texts being uncertain, it may be better to
associate these occurrences with  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> rather than  <span dir="rtl">פָּרָק</span>, in view of
the MHeb. vocalisation of a word with a similar meaning. One might even
consider whether the vocalisation of the BHeb. word should also be
reviewed, since the vowels in MT relate to the Qere
<span dir="rtl">ומרק</span>.

<span id="ExB1"><b>B.1</b></span>
Paul Volz (1932:277, 279) states his preference for the reading  <span dir="rtl">ומרק</span>, saying that it even appears as the Ketiv in some mss. Claus Westermann (1969:399, 401) and John Goldingay (2014:427 n. 7) follow this reading without mentioning the problem. 


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>   <span dir="rtl">פָּרָק</span>, as the more difficult reading, is probably original in Isa
65:4 and in view of the parallel most likely refers to pieces of meat
‘torn off’ (cf. the meaning of the verb  <span dir="rtl">פָּרַק</span>) a larger joint.


<b>A.2</b>  In 4Q385 and 4Q386 the meaning must be the ‘(bone) joint’ to which
some cognates in Hebrew and possibly Syriac point (cf. <a href="#ExA2">Exegesis A.2</a>).
The word should perhaps be vocalised  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>.
