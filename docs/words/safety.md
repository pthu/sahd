### Text Doubtful

<b>B.1</b><a id="IntrB1"></a> At Hab 3:13 the  <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span> following the second  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> has been taken to indicate that a verb is required, and an infinitive can easily be substituted in view of the prefix  <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> before the noun. Ward (1959:27) suggests that this is called for, not only by the sign of the direct object, but also by the LXX’s infinitives, both in the Old Greek and in the variant text of Codex Venetus and other mss cited by him (on the latter see Ziegler 1967:37-39, 80-81, 274; Jellicoe 1968:198; Glenny 2017:616). And yet only one of the two nouns in that verse is translated by an infinitive, and even then in the Old Greek it is an articular infinitive, which operates more as a noun than as a verb. It
should be noted that an articular infinitive renders the noun
[<span dir="rtl">מוֹשָׁעָה</span>] at Ps 68[67]:21 in the same manner. It could be argued in the other direction that the  <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span> is an addition by a later scribe who
read  <span dir="rtl">לישׁע</span> as a verb rather than a noun with prefix. Freedman (1972:535) prefers to understand the  <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span> either as an emphasizing particle or as the second person masculine pronoun (written defectively) to call attention to the pronominal suffix on the following noun. BHK also proposes reading a verb, emending the nouns to the hiph. inf. <span dir="rtl">לְהוֹשִׁיעַ</span> (cf. Wellhausen; GKC, §115d), whilst Dahood suggests that such emendation is not necessary if one only changes the vocalization to read a hypothetical <i>yiphil</i> form,  <span dir="rtl">יֹשִׁיעַ</span> (‘<i>yōšīaʿ</i> ’; 1979:258–59). It may simply be the object marker after an abstract noun, perhaps also found at Deut 7:8 (GKC, §115d). For further proposals and discussion see Andersen 2001:334-35.


<b>B.2</b>  If the form  <span dir="rtl">יֹשַׁעֲכֶם</span> at Isa 35:4 were to be taken as a nominal form, then we either have an alternative spelling of the noun
(Wernberg-Møller 1957:73) or a text that requires emendation. It is, however, probably the verb in this verse. See 
<a href="#FormCharB1">Formal Characteristics B.1</a>. 


<b>B.3</b><a id="IntrB3"></a> Although the NAB would correct the noun <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> to the verb at Job 5:11 (cited by Clines 1989:116), the noun can be understood as an adverbial accusative (see 
<a href="#SyntA3">Syntagmatics A.3</a>; GKC, §118q) and need not be emended.

<b>B.4</b>  The three letters  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> (with the <i>yodh</i> uncertain) appear on a late
third-century/early second-century inscription from Gerizim (Naveh and Magen 1997:43, text D). Since the inscription is broken off immediately before these letters, it is not possible to determine whether this is a whole word or part of it. It may be significant to note that the context suggests some form of dedicatory prayer, and the possible appearance of the word <span dir="rtl">יקום</span> (denoting resurrection?) could indicate that it is a prayer or Psalm to God. This would support the reading  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, a noun that
only appears in poetry in the OT and most often in prayers and Psalms.

<i>Qere/Ketiv</i>: none.

<b>A.1</b>  See <a href="/sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">ישׁע</span>: 1. Root and Comparative Material</a>.

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  Segholate noun. It is always found in the singular in OT.

<b>A.2</b>  The nominal form  <span dir="rtl">יוֹשַׁע</span> appears in the Babylonian tradition at Job
5:4, 11 and possibly in the MT itself at Isa 35:4 (Wernberg-Møller 1957:73). See B.1 below.

<b>B.1</b><a id="FormCharB1"></a> The form  <span dir="rtl">יֹשַׁעֲכֶם</span> at Isa 35:4 is sometimes seen as an incorrect vocalization of the verb (so BHS), and Watts (1987:7) concludes that the verb and meaning is clear, even if the form is not. Wernberg-Møller reads it as the noun, but this is less likely.

## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is subject of the verb  <span dir="rtl">יָצָא</span>, ‘to go out’ (Isa 51:5),  <span dir="rtl">בּוֹא</span>, ‘to come’ (Isa 62:11)), גלה niph., ‘to be revealed’ (CD-B 20:20; 1QH<sup><small>a</small></sup> 13:14).

<b>A.2</b>   <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is the object of the verbs  <span dir="rtl">צמח</span> hiph., ‘to cause to spring up’ (2 Sam 23:5),  <span dir="rtl">נָתַן</span> ‘to give’ (Ps 85:8), <span dir="rtl">ידע</span> hiph., ‘to make known’ (11Q5 18:2).  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is also the indirect object of the verb  <span dir="rtl">לבשׁ</span> hiph., ‘to clothe’ (Ps 132:16). It is preceded by the verbs  <span dir="rtl">שִׁית</span> + <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, ‘to place in’ (Ps 12:6),  <span dir="rtl">רָאָה</span> hiph. +  <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, ‘to show’ (Ps 50:23),  <span dir="rtl">רָחַק</span> +  <span dir="rtl">מִן</span>, ‘to be far from’ (Job 5:4),  <span dir="rtl">שָׂגַב</span>, ‘to be exalted’ (Job 5:11).

<b>A.3</b><a id="SyntA3"></a> At Job 5:11  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> follows immediately on <span dir="rtl">שָׂגַב</span>, ‘to be exalted’ without any preposition as an adverbial accusative (Gordis 1978:56; GKC, §118q).

<b>A.4</b>   <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is nomen regens of  <span dir="rtl">אֱלֹהִים</span>, ‘God’ (Ps 50:23), and of <span dir="rtl">פנים</span>, ‘face’ (4Q381 33ab+35:9).

<b>A.5</b><a id="SyntA5"></a> <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is the nomen rectum of  <span dir="rtl">אֱלֹהִים</span>, ‘God’ in liturgical contexts (Isa 17:10; Mic 7:7; Hab 3:18; Ps 18:47; 24:5; 25:5; 27:9; 65:6; 79:9; 85:5; 1 Chron 16:35; 4Q381 31:6; 4Q510 2:2). In most of these cases <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> has a pronominal suffix (‘my’, ‘your’, ‘his’, ‘our’).   
It is also the nomen rectum of things:  <span dir="rtl">קֶרֶן</span>, ‘horn’ (2 Sam 22:3; Ps 18:3),  <span dir="rtl">מָגֵן</span>, ‘shield’ (2 Sam 22:36; Ps 18:36),  <span dir="rtl">צוּר</span>, ‘rock’ (2 Sam 22:47; Ps 95:1),  <span dir="rtl">בְּגָדִים</span>, ‘clothes’ (Isa 61:10),  <span dir="rtl">גְּבֻרוֹת</span>, ‘powers’ (Ps 20:7), <span dir="rtl">שָׂשׂוֹן</span>, ‘joy’ (Ps 51:14), and  <span dir="rtl">אֱמֶת</span>, ‘faithfulness’ (Ps 69:14). It is the nomen rectum of <span dir="rtl">מולדים</span>, ‘births’ (4Q417 2 i 11), and <span dir="rtl">יום</span>, ‘day’ (11Q5 22:4).

<b>A.6</b>   <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is the predicate of  <span dir="rtl">יהוה</span> (Ps 27:1).  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> has as its
predicate the adj.  <span dir="rtl">קָרוֹב</span>, ‘near’ (Ps 85:10).

<b>A.7</b>   <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is in apposition to  <span dir="rtl">אלהים</span>, ‘God’ (Sir 51:1).

<b>A.8</b>  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is followed by <i>waw</i> +  <span dir="rtl">חֵפֶץ</span>, ‘delight’ (2 Sam 23:5) or follows  <span dir="rtl">אוֹר</span> + <i>waw</i> (Ps 27:1).

<b>B.1</b>  It is probable that at Isa 45:8  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> should be the subject of the
verb emended to  <span dir="rtl">וְיֵפֶר</span> (Westermann 1969:153).

<b>B.2</b>  The precise syntagmatic relationship in Hab 3:13 is uncertain (see <a href="#IntrB1">
Introduction: Text Doubtful B.1</a>).

[^6]: The English renderings of the Latin are based on Lewis & Short, <i>LD</i>, <i>s.v</i>.


<b>A.1</b><a id="AVersA1"></a> It is striking how often the LXX (σωτήρ), Pesh (<span dir="rtl">ܦܪܘܩܐ</span> [<i>pārōqā</i>]) and the Vg (<i>Iesus</i>, <i>salvator</i>) read the word as denoting a person rather than an abstract noun, although they do not agree on each passage to render this way. Tg to 2 Sam 22:36 and Isa 62:11 also read those passages as speaking of a ‘saviour’.

<b>A.2</b>  Tg to Isa 45:8 interprets the concept of salvation as the resurrection of the dead, a reflection of the Targum’s theological views rather than semantics. Likewise the Targum’s reading <span dir="rtl">צוֹרְכָא</span>, ‘necessity’ at 2 Sam 23:5 forms part of a midrashic text and is not evidence for the
semantics.

<b>A.3</b>  It is noticeable how the Pesh and Tg favour the root <i>prq</i>, and do
not once choose <i>šzb</i> or <i>pṣy</i>, roots often chosen for translating
cognates of  <span dir="rtl">פלט</span>,  <span dir="rtl">מלט</span> and  <span dir="rtl">נצל</span>.

<b>A.4</b>  The choice in the Vg of cognates of <i>salvare</i> distinguishes the word from  <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> where cognates of <i>liberare</i> were more popular (cf. Sawyer 1990:449).

<b>A.5</b><a id="AVersA5"></a>  The late Latin lexeme <i>sospitas</i>, ‘safety’ at Job 5:11, although not from the same root as most of the Vg’s choices, nonetheless conveys the same sense. In fact it is an apposite term since it has associations with divine safety in pagan writers. A cult title of Juno at Lanuvium was <i>Sospita</i> (Cicero, <i>De natura deorum</i> 1:82; see <i>OLD</i>, 1796), and <i>sospitatrix</i> was used of Isis (Apuleius, <i>Metamorphoses</i> 11:9, 25; <i>OLD</i>, 1796). Perhaps as a result of this association <i>sospitator</i>, ‘saviour, preserver, deliverer, redeemer’ (Lewis & Short, <i>LD</i>, 1734), another post-classical Latin noun, became a title used of Christ (<i>sospitator</i> <i>nostri generis</i>, Arnobius Afer 2:96).

<b>A.6</b>  At 2 Sam 23:5 the positional equivalent in Pesh is <span dir="rtl">ܨܒܝܢܐ</span> (<i>ṣbynʾ</i>), ‘favor, good will’ (Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 1271). Generally it is the equivalent of the noun  <span dir="rtl">חֵפֶץ</span>, which occurs in the following phrase (cf. Pesh on Qoh 12:10). In fact, since the positional equivalent of <span dir="rtl">חֵפֶץ</span> is <span dir="rtl">ܦܘܩܕܢܐ</span> (<i>puqdānā</i>), one might consider that for some reason Pesh has interchanged its renderings of <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> and  <span dir="rtl">חֵפֶץ</span>.[^7]

[^7]: On the phenomenon of inversion of renderings, see Smelik 1995:268-70.

<b>B.1</b>  The LXX translation ἔλεος ‘pity, mercy’ at Isa 45:8 renders the cause of God’s salvation, rather than the effect.

<b>B.2</b>  The LXX of Job 5:11 does not appear to translate  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span>, perhaps
finding difficulty with the syntax of the verse (see 
<a href="#SyntA3">Syntagmatics A.3</a>, and 
<a href="#IntrB3">Introduction: Text Doubtful B.3</a>).


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b> See in general <a href="sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#5-lexicalsemantic-fields"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">ישׁע</span>: 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields</a>.

<b>A.2</b><a id="LexA2"></a> <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is found in parallelism with <span dir="rtl">צוּר מָעוֹז</span>, ‘rock of refuge’ (Isa 17:10), <span dir="rtl">צְדָקָה</span>, ‘righteousness’ (Isa 61:10; CD-B 20:20; 4Q443 1:12), <span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>, ‘steadfastness’ (Ps 85:8).  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> also forms part of a series of words denoting protection (Ps 18:3).

<b>A.3</b><a id="LexA3"></a> <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is very frequent in the Psalms (20x), but never appears in the Pentateuch. Elsewhere it appears 4x 2 Sam, 5x Isa, 1x Mic, 3x Hab, 2x Job and 1x 1 Chron. This indicates that it is always found in poetry or prayer, since the instances in 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles are in addresses to God sung by the king.


## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b>   <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> in the lexica is glossed as ‘Rettung, Hilfe, Heil’ (Ges<sup><small>18</small></sup>, 511) and, in similar fashion, ‘i) safety, welfare, prosperity; ii) salvation; iii) victory’ (BDB, 447). It may perhaps be possible to bring
out further shades of meaning, especially on the basis of the syntagmatics.

<b>A.2</b>  The construct expressions containing  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> are frequent and present
colourful associations from which we may gain an insight into its
meaning.


<b>A.3</b>   <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> is frequently used of God, often in conjunction with terms
such as ‘rock’, ‘horn’ or ‘shield’, and in these cases  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> appears to
denote a permanent state (i.e. of God’s nature), even when it is used of
God in response to his action on a particular occasion (e.g., 2 Sam 22:3,
47). It appears to be a definition of God’s nature in some cases (Mic
7:7; Hab 3:18). As this is a frequent feature of  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span>, it is to be
distinguished from  <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> and  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span> in this respect: it often
means ‘a state or place of safety’.


<b>A.4</b>  Sawyer (1990:446) concludes that  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> comes to those in need but does not
‘rescue’ or remove them from danger. It is in this respect more of a state than an action, visible in its association with  <span dir="rtl">צְדָקָה</span>, ‘righteousness’ (Isa 45:8; 51:5; 61:10), and its role as a reward (Isa 62:11).  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> comes to those that need it at Isa 51:5.


<b>A.5</b><a id="ExA5"></a>  The connotation at Isa 51:5 may be ‘victory’, which is certainly the implication of 2 Sam 22:36 where it is in a battle context. It may be
significant for the battle context in 2 Sam 22:26 that the nomen regens is  <span dir="rtl">מָגֵן</span>, ‘shield’.


<b>A.6</b><a id="ExA6"></a>  The sense of ‘saving’ for  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> only appears foremost at Hab 3:13,
Ps 18:3, 36(?) and Isa 17:10. Elsewhere it seems to denote ‘assistance’ (2 Sam 23:5) or ‘prosperity’ (Ps 12:6).

## 7. Conclusion


<b>A.1</b>   <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> appears only in poetical or liturgical contexts (<a href="#LexA3">Lexical/Semantic Fields A.3</a>), and therefore it is understandable that it is used in addresses to God. It frequently expresses a reciprocal relationship between God and the speaker in the expressions ‘God of my/your/our <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span>’ (<a href="#SyntA5">Syntagmatics A.5</a>). In such cases God is praised for the <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> that he brings to the recipient-speaker. Such a construction is used almost exclusively with this noun amongst the cognates. The LXX, Pesh, and Vg likewise render this use by nouns denoting ‘saviour’ or (in the case of the Vg) ‘Jesus’ (<a href="#AVersA1">Ancient Versions A.1</a>, <a href="#AVersA5">A.5</a>), renderings that are rare elsewhere in the semantic field.


<b>A.2</b>  The Versional renderings appear to distinguish this lexeme from  <span dir="rtl">פלט</span>, <span dir="rtl">מלט</span> and  <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> (Versions A.3, A.4) and this also can be detected in the meaning. Whereas these latter lexemes denote movement to safety in some
direction,  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> by contrast has a stative force. As it is frequently
the nomen rectum of nouns denoting defence or power,  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> (<a href="#SyntA5">Syntagmatics A.5</a>; 
cf. <a href="#LexA2">Lexical/Semantic Fields A.2</a>) seems to be a lexeme denoting a safe state rather than a movement to safety. It is, therefore, on rare occasions only that it can be glossed by ‘salvation’. This stative connotation also accounts for its use to denote general ‘prosperity’ (Ps 12:6; see <a href="#ExA6">Exegesis A.6</a>). It may also account for its use only in the singular; a ‘state’ rather than ‘acts’. 

<b>A.3</b>  In some instances  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> may also mean ‘help’ or ‘victory’ (<a href="#ExA5">Exegesis A.5</a>, <a href="#ExA6">A.6</a>), but these meanings are not so frequent with this lexeme as
they are with  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>.
