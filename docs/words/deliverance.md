## 1. Root and Comparative Material 
 
**A.1**  [See עשׁי] 
 
**A.2**  The etymology of הָעוּשְּׁת is controversial: morphologically it seems to be 
necessary to regard the taw as a formative element, so that the root would be עושׁ (Ayin 
Waw), but according to its sense(s) an association with עשׁי has often been thought to be 
required. 
 
**A.3**  BDB recorded (:448a) that ‘most assign it to עושׁ, but no sufficient evidence for 
existence of such a √’. Presumably they meant that there was no evidence for a root עושׁ as 
a by-form of עשׁי: this is in fact what they say (:447b) about ַ עוֹשׁ, ‘acc. to most from second. 
√
ַעושׁ= עשׁי … (cf. הָעוּשְּׁת infr.); but actual existence of such a √ not proven; Thes allows ַ עוֹשׁ 
= ְַּיוֹשַׁ ע’. On הָעוּשְּׁת BDB say (after giving its meaning as ‘deliverance, salvation’): ‘= 
ְַּישׁוַָּעה 
(formed by false anal., as if from √
ַשׁעו, in sense of עשׁי)’. 
 
**A.4**  It can no longer be said that ‘most’ favour a derivation of הָעוּשְּׁת from עושׁ. The 
major recent dictionaries, like BDB, all relate it to עשׁי (HAL:1657a; Ges18:1461a; Clines: 
8, 684). Only a minority of scholars think differently. Kopf (1958:206-207) defended the 
association with עושׁ, but in the form of ע וָשׁ = ‘cry’, claiming that it was in turn cognate 
with Ar ǵawwata (i.e. a word with the corresponding consonants in the reverse order, so 
assuming metathesis, a shaky argument according to Barr [1968:97-98]), which means 
specifically ‘cry for help’. Presumably he saw this as related to the sense of ‘help’ which 
הָעוּשְּׁת can have. Sawyer too preferred a connection of הָעוּשְּׁת with עושׁ, but as a ‘by-form’ of 
עשׁי and without detailed discussionַ(3:1042; cf. 1037-38). He also allowed the possibility 
that והשׁיע ‘could’ be the basis for הָעוּשְּׁת. 
 
**B.1**  Ges18 (:1461b) cite an article by Rabin (1963:114-117) as providing discussion 
of הָעוּשְּׁת, but this is an error, as that part of the article is about וּשְּׁתַָקה (so correctly Clines: 8, 
767). 
 
## 2. Formal Characteristics 
 
**A.1**  The pattern is taqtul(at) (BL §496r-u). BL indicate that most such nouns are 
from Ayin Waw roots, but there are three from ‘other weak roots, which are not or are no 
longer Ayin Yodh/Waw’: תקופה (from ףיקה/ףקנ), תרופה (cf. אפר) and העושׁת (from והשׁיע, 
‘perhaps under the influence of 
ְַּישׁוַָּעה’. Brockelmann (1908-1913:383 = §204a[3]) likewise 
saw העושׁת as modelled on this pattern, but as a secondary form of יהעושׁ. 
 
**A.2**  Regarding the close correspondence in form between הָעוּשְּׁי and הָעוּשְּׁת, Barth 
(:278) had earlier seen this pair as related to a phenomenon of substitution in Arabic which 
was distinct from nouns with a genuinely preformative element, where the same sense 
could be conveyed by nouns beginning with either mem or taw (:280-81). This does also 
clarify the curious formation of הָעוּשְּׁת while keeping it fully within the עשׁי word-group. 
 
**B.1**  Gevirtz (:60*-61*) apparently conflated the two phenomena distinguished by 
Barth (cf. A.2) and challenged Barth’s conclusion about the latter group, showing that there 
generally was a semantic distinction in such cases. Even if Gevirtz is correct in this, it is 
not relevant to the semantics of הָעוּשְּׁי and הָעוּשְּׁת, since (as Barth saw) the yodh in הָעוּשְּׁי is a 
root-letter and not a formative element.  

**B.2**  BL went on (in §496u) to conjecture that the root √
ַעושׁ was a secondary 
development from הָעוּשְּׁת, supposing that the noun 
ַ
ַ עוֹשׁ was from 
ַעָשׁ = ‘helper’: this inverts 
the argument criticised by BDB and is itself no more persuasive. It was criticised in HAL 
(:1657a), apparently on the basis that Kopf had shown that √
ַעושׁ (I) had a cognate of its 
own in Ar, with a distinct meaning and guttural consonant (cf.:1339-1340). 
 
## 3. Syntagmatics 
 
**A.1**  הָעוּשְּׁת is the subject of the verbs הָיָה ‘to be’(1Sm 11.9; 2Sm 19.3), רחא piel ‘to 
delay’ (Is 46.13), and אוֹבּ ‘to come’ (Ps 119.41). 
 
**A.2**  הָעוּשְּׁת is the direct object of the verbs ן תָנ ‘to give’ (Jdg 15.18; 2Kg 5.1; Is 
46.13; Ps 144.10), הָשָׁע ‘to do’ (1Sm 11.13; 19.5; 2Sm 23.10, 12). It is the object of the verb 
ר מָא ‘to say’ (Ps 40.11), רפס piel ‘to tell’ (Ps 71.15), and
ַ
ַשֵׁבָל‘to put on’ (2Ch 6.41). 
 
**A.3**  הָעוּשְּׁת is governed by עשׁי niph (Is 45.17) and hiph (1Ch 11.14), הָלָכ + ְַּל (Ps 
119.81), and הָיָה ‘to be’+ ְַּל (1Ch 19.12). 
 
**A.4**  הָעוּשְּׁת is nomen regens of
ַ
ַםיִמָלוֹע‘everlasting’ (Is 45.17), לֵאָרְּשִי ‘Israel’ (Jr 
3.23), םיִקיִד צ ‘the righteous’ (Ps 37.39), םָדָא ‘mankind’ (Ps 60.13; 108.13), and הוהי ‘Lord’ 
(Lm 3.26). 
 
**A.5**  הָעוּשְּׁת is nomen rectum of ֵַחץ ‘arrow’ (2Kg 13.17), pl ptc ב הָא ‘to love’ (Ps 
40.17), and םיִהלֱֹא ‘God’ (Ps 51.16). 
 
**A.6**  הָעוּשְּׁת is found in a nominal clause with הוהי בּ ‘in the Lord’ (Jr 3.23), (Ps 33.17), 
הוהיֵמ ‘from the Lord’ (Ps 37.39), הוהי ל ‘to the Lord’ (Pr 21.31) אְּוָשׁ ‘worthless’ (Ps 60.13; 
108.13), וֹל ‘in him’ [=םָדָא] (Ps146.3), and ץֵעוֹיַבֹרְּבּ ‘in an abundance of counsellors’ (Pr 
11.14; 24.6). 
 
**A.7**  הָעוּשְּׁת is modified only by the adjective לוֹדָג ‘great’ (Jdg 15.19; 1Sm 19.5; 2Sm 
23.10, 12; 1Ch 11.14; Sir 46.1). This may reflect its particular sense of victory. 
 
**A.8**  הָעוּשְּׁת, preceded by waw, follows the noun הָנוּמֱא ‘faithfulness’ (Ps 40.11). 
 
**A.9**  הָעוּשְּׁת is in apposition to יָנֹדֲא ‘Lord’ (Ps 38.23). 
 
**A.10**  הָעוּשְּׁת is found with a pronominal suffix on only eight occasions in the OT: 
1ps (Is 46.13; Ps 38.23; 51.16), 2p m s (Ps 40.11, 17; 71.15; 119.41, 81).

6.41); 
 
salutaris (Ps 40[39].11, 17; 71[70].15; 119[118].81; Lm 3.26); 
 
victoria (2Sm 19.3[2]). 
 
 
**A.1**  The meaning ‘victory’ is found for some translations in the Pesh (nṣḥnʾ), Tg 
(אָנָחְּצִנ) and Vg (victoria). 
 
**A.2**  The translation zdyqwtʾ in the Pesh Ps 50.16 is perhaps under the influence of 
הָקָדְּצ at the end of the verse (which is also translated by zdyqwtʾ). 
 
**A.3**  The Pesh at Ps 40.11 seems to read zdyqwtʾ ‘righteousness’ as the translation 
for הָעוּשְּׁת, but later in the verse הָקָדְּצ is translated by pwrqnʾ, implying that there has been a 
reversal of the pair. 
 
**A.4**  The Tg translates by the Hebrew loan-word אָתָעוּשְּׁת at 2Sm 19.3. 
 
**A.5**  On two occasions the Tg renders the noun הָעוּשְּׁת by the verbal form קיִר פ 
‘redeemer’ (Is 46.13; 1Ch 19.12), indicating that it is interpreting the noun as denoting a 
person. This is not a feature of the other Versions. 
 
 
**B.1**  In the Pesh tšbḥtʾ ‘praise’ at Ps 71.15 may well be a contextual interpretation, 
encouraged by the preceding phrase םויהַלכ (cf. Ps 44.9; 119.164; 145.2): note also how 
Pesh introduces šbḥ before prq in Ps 13.6. 
 
## 5. Lexical/Semantic Field(s) 
 
**A.1**  [See עשׁי hiphil] 
 
**A.2**  הָעוּשְּׁת is found in parallelism with הָקָדְּצ ‘righteousness’ (Is 46.13a; Ps 40.11; 
71.15), תֶרֶאְּפִת ‘glory, honour’ (Is 46.13b), 
ַָמזוּע ‘stronghold’ (Ps 37.39), הָרְּזֶע ‘help’ (Ps 
60.13; 108.13), דֶסֶח ‘loving kindness’ (Ps 119.41), and the verb 
ַ מטֵל ‘to save’ (Ps 33.17). 
 
**A.3**  In 11 of its 34 occurrences in the OT it is in prose passages (see Driver 
1890:90). 
 
 
**B.1**  [nil] 
 
## 6. Exegesis 
 
**A.1**  HAL’s glosses, ‘Hilfe, Rettung, Sieg’ (1657), cover the main uses of הָעוּשְּׁת. 
BDB divides the lexeme into two prime meanings of ‘deliverance, salvation’ (448), where 
‘deliverance’ should be understood as a physical act involving deliverance from battle, but 
also a general state rather than an action of victory and of help. BDB’s definition of ע שֵׁי 
includes the gloss ‘rescue’ (447), which might have been helpful here also. 
 
**A.2**  In prose הָעוּשְּׁת denotes a victory over one’s enemies that may imply deliverance 
from one’s opponents (Jdg 15.18; 1Sm 11.9, 13; 19.5; 2Sm 19.3; 23.10, 12; 2Kg 5.1; 2Kg 
13.17  [2x]), especially when it is the object of the verbs ן תָנ ‘to give’ or הָשָע ‘to make’ (e.g. 
Jdg 15.18; 1Sm 19.5). This meaning is clear for הָעוּשְּׁת, whilst ע שֵׁי is used in the context of 
victory but does not precisely denote it. הָעוּשְּׁת in prose in similar manner denotes assistance 
in battle (1Ch 19.12). 
 
**A.3**  In verse הָעוּשְּׁת may denote victory (Ps 33.17; 144.10; Pr 11.14; 21.31; 24.6) 
and also assistance (Ps 60.13; 108.13; 146.3), but equally often seems to denote the well-
being that God will bring about (Is 45.17; 46.13; Jr 3.23; Lm 3.26; Ps 119.41, 81). This 
might be the protection afforded to Israel, or the haven that God provides for the righteous 
(Ps 37.39). The synonymous parallelism with זוּעָמ ‘stronghold’ at Ps 37.39 suggests that 
הָעוּשְּׁת is a state of defence or protection. 
 
**A.4**  On one occasion הָעוּשְּׁת (+ 1p s pronominal suffix) is an epithet of the Lord. 
 
**A.5**  In 2Ch 6.41 Solomon prays that the priests may be ‘clothed with’ העושׁת, where 
clothing is a metaphor for endowment, as it is in Ps 132.8-9, on which this part of the 
prayer is closely modelled. Ps 132.9 speaks of being clothed with קֶדֶצ, but the Chronicler 
has preferred העושׁת on the basis of ע שֵׁי in the same idiom later in the psalm (v. 16), perhaps 
because he uses the root קדצ only in a moral sense elsewhere and this may have seemed 
inappropriate here. 
 
 
**B.1**  [nil] 
 
## 7. Conclusion 
 
**A.1**  A הָעוּשְּׁת is often ‘given’ or ‘made’ (Syntagmatics A.2) and only is described in 
the OT by the adjective ‘great’ (Syntagmatics A.7). These distinctive features of the noun 
may reflect its meanings in some cases of ‘victory’ and ‘help’, translations that the 
Versions occasionally choose (Versions A.3). Although the Versions are not consistent in 
such renderings for the same passages, this perhaps strengthens the case that they saw such 
meanings in the word rather than weakens it. Their renderings are not affected by the 
context of one particular passage, but are reflected in the use of the lexeme more generally. 
 
**A.2**  The more prosaic meaning of הָעוּשְּׁת (outlined in A.1) in comparison with ע שֵׁי or 
הָעוּשְּׁי is explained by its 11 appearances in prose texts in contrast to the latter 
(Lexical/Semantics Field(s) A.3). 
 
**A.3**  Although the meaning victory in battle suggests that וּשְּׁתהָע could denote 
deliverance, it often means little more than a state of well-being brought about by God 
(Exegesis A.3). The victory in battle is usually spoken about in the past so that it does not 
denote so much an act of deliverance, but more the state into which one has been brought. 
As ע שֵׁי it is only found in the singular. 
 
**A.4**  The usage of הָעוּשְּׁת, as indicated by Syntagmatics, Versions, Lexical Fields and 
Exegesis, confirms its association with the עשׁי group, even if its formal characteristics 
seem at first sight to point in a different direction.
