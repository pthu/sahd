**1. Statistics**



Torah: 0. Nebiim: 2. Ketubim: 1. Total: 3.



First of all there is the problem of establishing the correct lemma for this word. In MT it occurs only twice as <span dir="rtl">זִיקֹות</span>  in Isa. 50:11. So it is actually a *hapax legomenon* in the Hebrew Bible (not recognised as such by Cohen, *BHL* and Greenspahn *HLBH*). The most natural choice is to regard it as a plural of \*<span dir="rtl">זִיקָה</span>  (so  *TLB*, vol. 3, 30; *DCH*, vol. 3, 102). However, since many Hebrew nouns exist both in a masculine and a feminine form (cf. e.g. Sperber 1959) and feminine plurals are fairly common with masculine singulars (e.g. *GKC* §87m-p), a singular \*<span dir="rtl">זִיק</span>   is an acceptable alternative (so *HCHAT*, 361; *BDB*, 278). Other dictionaries refuse to choose between these two options (e.g. *GB*, 197, 204; *LHA*, 207; *KBL*, 254; *HALAT*, 257; *DBHE*, 169; *HAHAT*, 299). The circumstance that the masculine plural form <span dir="rtl">זיקים</span>   is well-attested in Postbiblical Hebrew (see sections 4 and 6 below) argues in favour of those who opt for the masculine form of the lemma.
The next question is whether the lemma also occurs in the form of <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  in Prov. 26:18. Apparently this has the same meaning as <span dir="rtl">זִיק</span>  in Isa. 50:11. Some scholars regard <span dir="rtl">זִיקֹות</span>  as a secondary form which developed from an original <span dir="rtl">זִרֹּות</span> , plural of <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  which in that case would be the more original form of the lemma (cf. Gesenius & Roediger, *TPC*,  424; *GKC* §20n). Whether this <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  in turn is same word as the <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  which is thought to mean  'fetter, chain' in Isa. 45:14; Nah. 3:10; Ps. 149:8; Job 36:8 depends on the etymology and basic meaning of all three words concerned (see section 4). To avoid confusion the statistics above are based only on the three passages where the word is thought to mean 'flaming missile' or 'torch'.


**2a. Literal Use** 



In Isa. 50:11 people  kindling a fire  (<span dir="rtl">קדח</span>  Qal <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span> ) are addressed. In the parallel colon they are called people 'girding' (<span dir="rtl">אזר</span>  Pi.)  <span dir="rtl">זִיקות</span> . In the next verse-line they are invited to walk into the blaze of their own fire<span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">אוּר</span>  | into the <span dir="rtl">זִיקֹות</span>  that they themselves burn (<span dir="rtl">בער</span>  Pi.). The use of the verb <span dir="rtl">אזר</span>  Pi. often caused translation problems. Duhm and others solved this by emendation (<span dir="rtl">זִיקֹות</span> <span dir="rtl">מְאִירֵי</span>  'those who light torches'). Nowadays most commentators suggest  <span dir="rtl">אזר</span>  Pi. has to be taken metaphorically, meaning that the people addressed surround themselves with torches, thus protecting themselves by their light. As a consequence, renderings like 'walk by the light of your fire' (RSV) came into existence. However, it is questionable whether <span dir="rtl">אוּר</span>  can mean 'light' (cf. Isa. 2:5; Ps. 56:14: <span dir="rtl">בְּאֹור</span> <span dir="rtl">הָלַך</span> !). Moreover, the verb <span dir="rtl">אזר</span>  Pi. occurs 6 times in the Hebrew Bible and in all other 5 cases it is a direct object that is girded. The verb is never used reflexively. Thus, it would be more appropriate to surmise that the people 'gird' or 'wrap' the torches (cf. Watts 1987, 194, who renders 'tying up torches'). Because it stands in parallelism with 'to kindle a fire',  it is more likely that the expression describes the preparation of torches by wrapping  wooden sticks in wool or pieces of cloth, and drenching them in oil, wax or bitumen (see below, section 8). This preparatory work nicely matches the kindling of fire.

Isa. 50:11 mockingly exhorts those who hope to illuminate the darkness surrounding them by man-made light instead of trusting in the <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Lord</span> (cf. 51:10). They kindle their torches -- possibly to participate in Babylonian nightly processions (cf. *RLA*, Bd. 3, 2) -- but these torches will become a pyre on which they will burn (one should not emend <span dir="rtl">אוּר</span>  into <span dir="rtl">אֹור</span> , cf. Korpel & De Moor 1998, 449, n. 7, 486). They  seem to forget that it is God himself who commands both the darkness of judgment (Isa. 50:3; 51:6; cf. 47:5, 14) and the light of salvation (51:4, cf. 42:16; 45:7; 49:6). 

In Prov. 26:18 the plural <span dir="rtl">זִרִּים</span>  is used, which presupposes a singular <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>   (also known from Jewish Aramaic, see below).  It occurs in the expression  <span dir="rtl">וָמָוֶת</span> <span dir="rtl">חִקִּים</span> <span dir="rtl">זִרִּים</span> <span dir="rtl">הַיֹּרֶה</span> , literally 'one who continuously shoots <span dir="rtl">זִרִּים</span> , arrows and death'. He who deceives his neighbour is like a madman wildly shooting off <span dir="rtl">זִרִּים</span> , arrows (<span dir="rtl">חִקִּים</span> ) and death (<span dir="rtl">מָוֶת</span> ). Apparently the writer saw the <span dir="rtl">זִרִּים</span>  as potentially deadly weapons which one should not handle carelessly. If it is admissable to view the sequal, Prov. 26:19-20, as an elaboration of the imagery, the missiles are fiery here too. Both biblical texts suggest a kind of torch or fiery missile.




**2b. Figurative Use**



Not attested in biblical Hebrew.



**3. Epigraphic Hebrew**



Not attested.



**4. Cognates**



Klein, *CEDHL*, 197,  does not indicate which root he prefers for <span dir="rtl">זִיק</span>  I, <span dir="rtl">זִיקָה</span>  and <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  II, but he derives <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  I 'chain, fetter' from the √<span dir="rtl">נזק</span> .Gesenius & Roediger, *TPC*, 424 and König, *HAWAT*, 89, 93, assume that both words have been derived from √\*<span dir="rtl">נזק</span> . This is a less exotic proposal than it may seem at first sight. It is indeed noteworthy that both <span dir="rtl">זִרִּים</span>   in Prov. 26:18 and <span dir="rtl">אֲזִרִּים</span>  in Jer. 40:1, 4 have a double <span dir="rtl">ק</span> . <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  is easily explained as a normal development: \**zinq* &gt; \**ziqq* &gt; <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span> . <span dir="rtl">זִיק</span>  has long been recognised as a case of metathesis of quantity (cf. *BL* §23c): the 'long' consonant *qq* with short preceding vowel *i* in \**ziqq* was exchanged for a long vowel *ī* with a 'short' (single) *q*: \**zīq* (cf. *GKC* §20n). Because the basic meaning of the root *znq* seems to be 'to wrap tightly' (see the cognates below) it seems indeed possible that   <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  II 'chain, fetter' is nothing but a semantic differentiation of <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  'torch'. The Pi. of <span dir="rtl">זנק</span>   which is thought to mean 'to leap forth' in Deut. 33:22 has nothing to do with our lemma. As seen by Guillaume 1959, this verb is a metathesis of √*nzq*, 'to storm ahead, rush forward'.




<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Akkadian</span>:The  noun is related to Neo-Asyrian  *zīqtu* 'torch', and *zīqu* II, 'torch', cf. *CAD* (Z), 133; *AHw*, 1532; Salonen, *Hausgeräte*, 138-145; Tawil, *ALCBH*, 90. 









<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Postbiblical Hebrew</span>:See below, section 6. For some (rare) rabbinic references, Levy, *WTM*, Bd. 1, 531: 'Feuerkugel, Brandpfeil ... ein Komet'; 
Jastrow, *DTT*, 395:'sparks, burning arrows ... meteors, shooting stars.



<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Jewish Aramaic</span>:In the Aramaic Henoch <span dir="rtl">זיקא</span>  'meteor' occurs several times (4Q201:IV.3; 4Q204:VI.20, 24, 30, next to thunder and lightning). In other apocalyptic works these 'meteors' are mentioned too (4Q246:II.1; .4Q558:Fr. 1, II.5). For Rabbinic Aramaic see Jastrow, *DTT*, 395: <span dir="rtl">זֵיק</span> , 'sparks, burning arrows; meteors, shooting stars [or comet]; Idem, 396: <span dir="rtl">זִיקָא</span>  I, '1. shooting star, or comet; 2. blast, wind, draught (spirit)'. The Job Targum from Qumran renders the Hebrew <span dir="rtl">לַפִּּידִים</span>  'torches' of Job 41:11 as <span dir="rtl">זיקין</span>   (11Q10:XXXVI.6). With regard to rabbinic Aramaic, cf.<span dir="rtl">זיקא</span>  2, according to Sokoloff, *DJPA*, 176: 'flash of fire, comet, demon'; <span dir="rtl">זיקוק</span>  'spark' (see also Sokoloff, *DJBA*, 411).




<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Syriac</span>:Payne Smith (Margoliouth), *CSD*, 115: *zīqā* and *zīqtā*, 'a. violent rain with wind; rain falling in great drops; boisterous wind; b. a shooting star, metaph. radiancy'. Idem, 115: *znaq* 'to shoot an arrow, to hurl, sling'.





<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Classical Arabic</span>:*zanaqa* 'to tighten, constrict' (Wehr, *DMWA*, 383). Lane, *AEL*, 1259: *zanaq* 'thin part of an arrow-head'. See theintroductory part of section 4 above.








**5. Ancient Versions**



LXX and other Greek versions: Isa. 50:11 φλὸξ -- *GELS-L* (1992-1996), 505 and *GELS-L* (rev.ed. 2003), 650:  'flame; light, shine; blade (of a flashing sword)'. Interesting is the fact that LXX translates  'to gird the torches' as  'to strengthen/to feed the torches' (κατισχύω φλόγα), which also might refer to the binding of pine splinters with cloth or wool into a bundle, and made inflammable with oil, resin or bitumen. Prov. 26:18 ρJόπαλον --  *GELS-L* (1992-1996), 418 and *GELS-L* (rev.ed. 2003), 544:  'club (weapon)'. It is paralleled by sword (μάχαιρα) and arrow (τόξευμα).  




Tg.: Isa. 50:11  <span dir="rtl">חרב</span> <span dir="rtl">מתקפי</span>  '(all you) who grasp a sword'. 


Syr.: 
Isa. 50:11 *šalhebītā* -- Payne Smith (Margoliouth), *CSD*, 518: 'flame, blaze'; the paraphrasis of Syr. in Prov. 26:18 does not allow a definite identification of its rendering of  <span dir="rtl">זִרִּים</span> : 'Like the behaviour of boys throwing things (or: words), so are the sharp arrows of death'.


Vulg.: 
Isa. 50:11 *flamma*, 'flame'; Prov. 26:18 *lancea*, 'lance'.



**6. Judaic Sources**



In Sir. 43:13 (17) -- according to manuscripts M and B -- God's <span dir="rtl">משׁפט</span> <span dir="rtl">זיקות</span>  'fiery missiles of judgment' light up in the sky, accompanying his hail (<span dir="rtl">ברד</span> ).Both the Hebrew and Aramaic texts of Qumran mention the <span dir="rtl">זיקים/זיקיא</span> . Here too the expression <span dir="rtl">משׁפט</span> <span dir="rtl">זקי</span>  'fiery missiles of judgment' occurs (1QH<sup>a</sup>16.37). According to 1QM 6.2-3 'fiery missiles of blood' (<span dir="rtl">דם</span> <span dir="rtl">זיקי</span> ) shall be written on darts (<span dir="rtl">שׁלט</span> ).  CD-A 5:13 clearly alludes to Isa. 50:11, when it describes followers of Belial as <span dir="rtl">זיקות</span> <span dir="rtl">ומבערי</span> <span dir="rtl">אשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">קדחי</span> ,  'kindlers of fire and igniters of fiery missiles'. 1QH<sup>a</sup> 9:12 pairs <span dir="rtl">וברקים</span> <span dir="rtl">זקים</span>  'fiery missiles and lightnings'. Apparently these missiles have acquired a celestial, apocalyptic status.


**7. Illustrations**



On the well-known relief depicting Sennacherib's siege of Lachish an Assyrian soldier who is almost entirely hidden behind the archer in the foreground is igniting tightly wrapped missiles with a torch (→ <span dir="rtl">לַפִּּיד</span> ), \includegraphics\*{zyq_lachish.eps}


Unfortunately it is unclear how the Assyrians hurled these projectiles into the city, but the association with arrows  and fire matches the biblical data.


On the Baal-stele from Ugarit the lightning spear the god holds in his left hand is a kind of burning arrow. For the imagery, see e.g. Cornelius 1994. Probably, the  idea was that lightning was created by the god Baʿal throwing his flaming arrows from heaven. 



**8. Archaeological Remarks**



The material used to make  <span dir="rtl">זִיקֹות</span>  cannot have been very different from that of torches. According to Salonen, *Hausgeräte*, 138-145, esp. 138, torches were made of wood and wool, seldom bronze was used for the haft. The ideogram for  the word 'torch' is <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">izi</span> 'burning torch, fire'. The wick or burner was made of wool or a piece of woolen cloth. In Sumerian several words were used for the torch, mostly constructed with <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">gi</span> 'reed-stem' and <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">izi</span> 'fire'. The Neo-Assyrian word *ziqtu* (see above) is marked as combustible material by the determinative *giš* 'wood' (Von Soden, *AHW*, vol. 3, 1532). In one text the making of the torch is described, 'you insert cedar, cypress and aromatic reed into two torches, wrap white and red wool around them, set fire (to them) by means of sulphur and throw them on the pyre' (Salonen, *Hausgeräte*, 143). Often resinous wood like pine was used to make a torch from a bundle of kindle-wood splinters bound around a stick (Salonen, *Hausgeräte*, 144-5; Forbes, *SAT*, vol. 6, 129, 131). Torches not only were used for lightning but also as a kind of telegraphy. Staves of pine wood were used to which reeds and branches of olive trees were attached by a cord (Forbes, *SAT*, vol. 9, 174).

In ancient Greece too bundles of splinters were used as torches. They were made of resinous wood, and bound together with rushes, papyrus, or vine tendrils, and drenched into resin, pitch or wax (Forbes, *SAT*, vol. 9, 131). Torches were used predominantly when going out by night. The Romans too used *malleoli* , 'fire-darts'  and *fasces sarmentorum*, 'bundles of twigs', to start a fire in the cities they besieged (cf. Lewis & Short *LD*, 1104).



**9. Conclusion**



The evidence assembled warrants the conclusion that <span dir="rtl">זִיק</span>  and <span dir="rtl">זֵק</span>  are the same word which designated a missile made of tightly wrapped rushes or kindle-wood, impregnated with combustible fluids. As such it could also be used as a dreaded type of weapon that could be used to kindle a besieged city. Only later on it became a designation of comets or heavenly demons, although it is possible that this was derived from existing popular belief. See also → <span dir="rtl">לַפִּּיד</span> .

The root from which the word was derived is most likely the Semitic √*nzq* 'to wrap tightly'. There is insufficient reason to assume the existence of a feminine form \*<span dir="rtl">זִיקָה</span> .
