## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> 
<i>Root.</i>
According to Klein the root is ‘of uncertain etymology. cp. Egypt. <i>ma-qi-ra</i>.’<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:1')">1</a></sup> The latter was proposed by Albright.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:2')">2</a></sup> Also Helck and Hoch regard it as a Semitic loanword in Egyptian,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:3')">3</a></sup> so this does not help us with regard to the Hebrew word’s etymology. Some scholars confidently declare √<span dir="rtl">קלל</span> to be the root<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:4')">4</a></sup> or raise other possibilities, like a √<span dir="rtl">נקל</span>, or even √<span dir="rtl">בקל</span> or √<span dir="rtl">מקל</span>, all three otherwise unattested in Hebrew.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:5')">5</a></sup> Since the Hiph. of √<span dir="rtl">קלל</span> is attested in biblical Hebrew, it would seem safest to assume an original meaning ‘instrument to make lighter, faster’,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:6')">6</a></sup> i.e. an instrument to increase a person’s mobility. As a consequence, one has to assume that the meaning ‘branch’ would be a secondary development. The √<i>qll</i> ‘to be light, swift’ is attested in many Semitic languages.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:7')">7</a></sup> An Indo-Mediterranean origin<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:8')">8</a></sup> is less likely.

<b>A.2</b>
<a id="rab"></a><i>Rabbinical literature.</i>
In the Hebrew text of Jesus Sirach and the Dead Sea Scrolls <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>  is not attested. The term occurs several times in Mishnaic and Talmudic tractates, mostly in the sense of a walking stick,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:9')">9</a></sup> which also serves for defence<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:10')">10</a></sup> or to discipline.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:11')">11</a></sup> Its worked character comes to the fore in the fact that it could have a secret receptacle for a <i>mezūzah</i> or jewels.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:12')">12</a></sup> These texts confirm the Old Testament range of functions of the staff.

## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Literal Use

<b>A.1</b>
<span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>  appears to be a fresh branch of a tree in Jeremiah’s vocation story. Here the term indicates a branch in its natural condition because no other site is mentioned in connection to it: ‘I see a branch of an almond’ (Jer 1:11; cf. v.13: ‘a boiling pot facing away from the north’<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:18')">18</a></sup>). Whether or not the wordplay between the vision (‘almond’, <span dir="rtl">שָׁקֵד</span>, v. 11) and the explanation (‘I am watching’, <span dir="rtl">שֹׁקֵד</span>, v. 12) involves a blossoming branch because the almond is the first in spring to blossom, is disputed.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:19')">19</a></sup> In all other texts, a <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>  is a rod taken from a tree. As a consequence, it is unlikely that Jeremiah in his vision was not watching a real almond tree but the rod of Aaron, a cultic object preserved in the temple of Jerusalem, which presence there is is explained in Num 17:16-26 (1-11), the more so since in this story Aaron’s staff is always called <a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mfh.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">מַטֶּה</a></span>.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:20')">20</a></sup> A <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>  is light enough to be carried and strong enough to be leant on during journeys through rough territory (Gen 32:11; Exod 12:11),  to discipline domesticated animals and to beat off aggressive ones with it (Num 22:27; 1 Sam 17:40, 43) or to be used as a weapon (Ezek 39:9).  Only once it occurs, parallel to <a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mfh.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">מַטֶּה</a></span>, as a prestigious symbol of authority (Jer 48:17).

<b>A.2</b>
In the story of how Jacob manipulated the breeding of Laban’s flocks (Gen 30:31-43), the meaning of <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>  as a freshly peeled branch is clear (vv. 37-41). Obscure, however, is the function of these rods placed near the watering troughs (v.39<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:21')">21</a></sup>). Explanations diverge from fertility magic (things observed by living beings during the conception, in this case varicoloured rods, would leave their characteristics on the offspring) to breeding techniques, well-known in olden times, of medical or aphrodisiac impact. Nevertheless, parallels from the Ancient Near East with regard to these insights and practices are lacking. The complexity of the story is partly put right if the phrase <span dir="rtl">הַמַּקְלֹות</span><span dir="rtl">אֶל־</span> (v. 39) is translated not as usually ‘at the sight of the rods’ or ‘near the rods’, but ‘upon the rods’, conceived as a <i>phallus fallax</i> or teaser animal. Jacob misleads the animals which he does not want to be impregnated, as part of a more sophisticated procedure to enrich himself with a strong flock while providing Laban with a flock of weaker animals. The story has to be interpreted as a revenge for Laban’s treatment of Jacob in Gen 28. Laban had tricked Jacob into receiving the ‘wild cow’ Leah instead of the ‘ewe lamb’ Rachel. Here, Jacob tricks Laban into giving him the lambs he desires.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:22')">22</a></sup> ‘Rod’ as euphemism for phallus may also play a role in Hosea’s accusation of rhabdomantic: ‘My people inquire of a thing of wood, and their staff (<span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>) gives them oracles. For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray’ (4:12<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:23')">23</a></sup>). On the other hand, in Gen 30 the context, esp. vv. 37-38 and 40-42, suggests that real striped rods were involved in a more or less magical way. The parallel word <span dir="rtl">עֵצּ</span> in Hos 4:12 is never used as a euphemism for the <i>membrum virile</i>. So it remains uncertain whether <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span> could have this figurative meaning. Rather it hints at the practice of obtaining oracles by shaking sticks in a container.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:24')">24</a></sup>

### 6.2 Figurative Use

<b>A.1</b> 
In the prophetic symbolic action of Zech 11:4-14, the term <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>  designates two ‘rods’ of a shepherd, called ‘Delight’ and ‘Bonds’ (esp. vv. 7, 10, 14<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:25')">25</a></sup>). A shepherd often carried two staves with him (<a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mfh.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">מַטֶּה</a></span>). <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span>’s command ‘to shepherd a flock doomed to slaughter’ (v. 4) leads the prophet to taking these two rods which embody the ideological programme of his ministry (v. 7), just as he will later symbolise its failure by breaking them (vv. 10, 14). The story draws on older prophetic themes. A first tradition is that of the evil shepherds, the leaders of Israel, who have not fulfilled their responsibilities and enriched themselves instead of taking care of the needs of the flock (Ezek 34). As opposed to this allegory, the Zechariah narrative does not promise a better future: neither God nor the prophetic shepherd is to guide the herd for its own welfare. Instead, the prophet is to punish the buyers and sellers by leaving the flock to complete abandonment and destruction (v. 8-9). The focus is so much on the chastisement of the elite that the rescue of the flock is not at stake. A second tradition at the basis of this symbolic act is the one to which Ezekiel was called, i.e. the joining of two pieces of ‘wood’ (<span dir="rtl">עֵצּ</span>) with the names of ‘Judah’ and ’Joseph’, which means that ‘they shall be no longer two nations’ (Ezek 37:15-23, esp. v. 22). What Zechariah does with the second rod, ‘Bonds’, forms the counterpart of that story. By severing this rod he clarifies that ‘the kinship between Judah and Israel is broken’ (v. 14). His severing of the first rod, ‘Delight’, which stands for ‘the annulling of the covenant that I had made with all the peoples (i.e. the component tribes of Israel)’ (v. 10), has no counterpart in a specific rod in the Ezekiel story. It could be, however, an antithetic elaboration of the second purport of Ezechiel’s act, i.e. the renewal of the covenant: ‘and they shall be my people, and I will be their God’ (Ezek 37:23).  In this way, because the taking of the rods is subservient to their breaking, the story as a whole points retrospectively to the failure of Israelite prophecy (cf. ‘the hardening of the people’ by Isaiah [6:8-10] and the <i>confessiones</i> of Jeremiah [esp. 20:7-18]).

<b>A.2</b> 
The circumstance that the rods are given names, points to the fact that they could function as symbols of authority (<a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mfh.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">מַטֶּה</a></span>). The names of the two rods here have no traditio-historical background. The first one, ‘Delight’ (<span dir="rtl">נֹעַם</span>), has a variety of meanings, reaching from ‘pleasantness’ parallel with ‘peace’ (Prov 3:17), ‘purity’ (Prov 15:26) and ‘health’ (Prov 16:24),  to the ‘favour’ which people enjoy in the presence of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span> (Ps 16:11; 27:4; 90:17).  Since its semantic basis involves some form of good relationship, it is a fitting term for the covenant of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span> with his people. The second term, ‘Bonds’ (<span dir="rtl">חֹבְלִים</span>  [active participle]), is a concrete noun. It might hint at the reciprocity of commitment between Judah and Israel, the more so since √<span dir="rtl">חבל</span>  is associated with the idea of pledging. At the same time, an association with the noun <span dir="rtl">חֶבֶל</span>  for ‘territory, allotted portion’ seems to be intended since the two kingdoms are  allied to each other by the apportioning of the Land (cf. Deut 32:9; Josh 17:14; Zeph 2:7; Ps 105:11). Both names, however, witness to the originality in wording of this prophetic symbolic action.

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
Whether ‘branch’ (Gen 30:31-43; Jer 1:11) or ‘instrument to make (walking) lighter, swifter’, hence ‘staff’ (almost all other occurrences), is the more original meaning is uncertain. Like other Hebrew words for staves the <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span> could serve as a symbol of authority. The ancient versions seem to indicate that at least in later times little difference was made between the various types of rods and staves. 

<b>A.2</b>
In Zech 11:4-14 the staves are a symbol of the prophet’s ideological ministry and its failure. People could give names to their staves (Zech 11:7, 10, 14), as they did with other objects of a personal nature, e.g. weapons. More or less magical use of the <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span> might attested in Gen 30:31-43 and Hos 4:12, or it might be a metaphor for the <i>membrum virile</i> there. The word occurs as a Semitic loanword in Egyptian. One of its attestations there seems to indicate that a <span dir="rtl">מַקֵּל</span>  could have a knob of painted wood.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:26')">26</a></sup> Perhaps this knob sometimes contained a secret hollow to hide a precious object in (<a href="#rab">1. Root and Comparitive Material, Rabbinical Literature</a>).
