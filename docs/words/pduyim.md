## Introduction

Grammatical type: n.m. pl.abstr.  
Occurrences: 6x HB (6/0/0); 0x Sir; 3x Qum; 0x inscr. (Total: 9).

* Torah: Num 3:46, 48, 49(2x; see A.1), 51; 18:16.
* Qum: 4Q270 2 ii:8[2x], 9.

### Text doubtful:

<b>A.1</b> The unique occurrence of  <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹם</span> in the MT of Num 3:49 is read as
<span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> in the Sam. text, which both BDB (804) and <i>BHS</i> follow.
<span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹם</span> might be a by-form of  <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span>, as there are few nouns with afformative <span dir="rtl">ם</span>– (GK §85t; JM §88Ml), but the use of <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> in the exactly corresponding phrase in v. 51 and the firm preference for this form in the Priestly texts make the Sam. reading more likely to be original. The consonantal text of MT could readily have arisen by scribal error.

<b>A.2</b> It is uncertain whether <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיֵי</span> in Num 3:49 should be seen as a
noun, as elsewhere in 3:46-51, or as the pass.part. of the verb <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>. The latter is favoured by Gray (1903:32), NRSV and other modern
translations. It appears to be the view taken in Tg and Vg, and it produces a smoother sense.

<b>B.1</b> In 4Q511 36:3 <span dir="rtl">פדויים</span> is most likely the pass.part. of the verb <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>. The genre of the text makes a legal term out of place.

### Qere/Ketiv:

<b>A.1</b> Num 3:51 K <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹם</span> Q  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> according to BDB (804a), but the Leningrad Codex has no <i>Qere</i> here, and <i>BHS</i> implies that it only appears in some mss.

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b> <i>qatūl</i>: Joüon and Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §88Ec (abstract or action nouns),
§136f-i (on the use of the plural to represent intensity, abstraction or action; cf. BL, 517y and Köhler 1921:316). Cf. also 
<a href="/sahd/words/redemption/"><span dir="rtl">גאולים</span></a>.

## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> appears as object of the verbs: 

* <span dir="rtl">לקח</span>, ‘to take’: Num 3:46, 49;
* <span dir="rtl">נתן</span>, ‘to give’: Num 3:48 (in apposition to <span dir="rtl">כסף</span>, ‘silver’; ind.obj. Aaron and his sons), 51 (ind.obj. Aaron and his sons).

<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> is nomen regens of 

* <span dir="rtl">הַשְּׁלֹשָׁה וְהַשִּׁבְעִים וְהַמָּאתָיִם</span>  ‘the 273 (surplus)’: Num 3:46; 
* <span dir="rtl">הָעֹדְפִים בָּהֶם</span>, ‘those left over/in excess’: Num 3:48; 
* <span dir="rtl">הלוים</span>, ‘the Levites’: Num 3:49; 
* <span dir="rtl">[בכור הבה]מה הטמא</span>, ‘the [firstborn of] the unclean [ani]mal’ and  <span dir="rtl">נפשׁם</span>, ‘their souls/lives’: 4Q270 2 ii:8-9.

<b>A.3</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> is nomen rectum of <span dir="rtl">כסף</span>, ‘silver’ (Num 3:49, 51).

<b>A.4</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> is used with 3 masc.sg. sf. of the firstborn of (?human beings and) unclean animals (Num 18:16).

<b>A.5</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> is used with the prep. <span dir="rtl">על</span> preceded by <span dir="rtl">העדפים</span> (Num 3:49).

<b>A.6</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> is used as a casus pendens (or in a nominal clause) with a specified price (Num 18:16).

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>:

* ἐκλύτρωσις, ‘act of redemption’: Num 3:49;
* λύτρον pl., ‘sum payable as ransom’: Num 3:46, 48, 49, 51;
* λύτρωσις, ‘act of redemption’: Num 18:16.

<b>A.1</b> In four cases LXX treats <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> as a word for the payment made, in the other two as a word for the action of paying. The distinction is hardly necessary.

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܦܘܪܩܢܐ</span> (<i>purqānā</i>), ‘salvation, redemption’: Num 3:46, 48, 49 (2x), 51, 18:16.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: O/N/PsJ)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">פורקנא</span>, ‘salvation, redemption’: 
Num 3:46<small><sup>O,N,PsJ</sup></small>, 
48<small><sup>O,N,PsJ</sup></small>, 
49<small><sup>1st:O,N,PsJ</sup></small>, 
49<small><sup>2nd:N,PsJ</sup></small>, 
18:16<small><sup>O,N,PsJ</sup></small>;
* <span dir="rtl">פריק</span>, part.pass. pl. of <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> peal, ‘to redeem’: Num 3:49<small><sup>2nd:O</sup></small>.

<b>A.1</b> Although the Targums generally render <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> by a noun, in Num 3:49 the second instance is represented by the part.pass. of the verb <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small>, as also in Vg.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>pretium</i>, ‘price’: Num 3:46,48;
* <i>redimo</i> pass.part., ‘to redeem’: Num 3:49<small><sup>2nd</sup></small>;
* <i>redemptio</i>, ‘redemption’: Num 18:16;
* no equivalent: Num 3:49<small><sup>1st</sup></small>, 51.

<b>A.1</b> The use of a verbal form for the second instance in Num 3:49 implies that it was taken to be the pass.part. of the verb  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, not a noun, as also in Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small>.

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b> See <a href="/sahd/words/to_liberate/#5-lexicalsemantic-fields"><span dir="rtl">פדה</span>: Lexical/Semantic Fields</a>.

<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> is closely associated with <span dir="rtl">כסף</span>, silver (Num 3:48, 49, 51), and in Num 18:16 it appears to be defined as ‘5 shekels of the sanctuary’. In comparable (non-cultic) contexts (Exod 21:30; Ps 49:8-9) <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> and <span dir="rtl">כֹּפֶר</span> are used with the same sense.

## 6. Exegesis

The only occurrences of <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> which refer to enforceable law are Num 18:16 and 4Q270 2 ii:8-9, both involving a redemption payment for a firstborn which is to be made to Aaron and/or his sons. The pseudo-historical account in Num 3:46-51 applies this to the role of the Levites as temple-servants in the Priestly Work and provides further information about the means of redeeming first-born humans, as it refers
to their cost. The first-born animals and humans of the Levites are to be given to God in place of (i.e. as a redemption for) the first-born of the whole of Israel (Num 3:41). <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> occurs in a construct with the number of first-born Israelites (273) above the number of Levites (3:46, 48). The redemption price for them is five shekels (3:47). Twice <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> occurs as <i>nomen rectum</i> with <span dir="rtl">כסף</span>, which seems to mean here ‘money of redemption’ (3:49, 51). Stamm (1976:395) distinguishes <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> from <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> by the idea of substitution or giving something in exchange for the object to be redeemed , which is supported by the use of <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> in Exod 13:13, 34:20, and the explanation of payment in Num 3:46-47. The focus on payment of equivalent value does seem to be prominent in  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, but it is not completely absent from the meaning of <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> (cf. Isa 52:3), in the idea of re-purchase. Both <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> and <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> seem to be related semantically to the noun <span dir="rtl">כפר</span> in this sense of payment for life, although the verb <span dir="rtl">כפר</span> is more closely connected to the idea of expiation (cf. Num
35:33; Deut 21:8).

## 7. Conclusion

<span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span>, like <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span>, means the price that is paid for redemption. Its use is limited to the cultic practice of the redemption of the firstborn in Priestly texts and Qumran law, whereas <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> is used
only in ‘profane’ contexts.
