### Text doubtful


<b>B.1</b> Powis Smith (1911:355) mentioned a proposal to emend the rare word in Nah 3:1 to a word  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶץ</span> with a closer meaning to the preceding <span dir="rtl">כחשׁ</span>. But it is preferable to retain the transmitted text, which may well be supported by 4Q169 f3 4.ii:1, as well as by several of the versions. The failure of LXX and Pesh to understand it is no reason to emend it. Bernhard Duhm (1911:67, also cited by Smith) prefixed
<span dir="rtl">וָ</span> to  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> to pair it with
[<span dir="rtl">הֶרֶג</span>] which he arbitrarily inserted before  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> to balance the metre. Smith (1911:334-35) also favoured a connection, but with  <span dir="rtl">כחשׁ</span>. It
is, however, more likely that they belong to separate lines.

Qere/Ketiv: none

## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  See also the entry for the verb 
<a href="/sahd/words/to_pull_off/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פָּרַק</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>.


<b>A.2</b>  Nouns from the root <i>prq</i> occur sporadically in several Semitic languages, and with some frequency in certain dialects of Aramaic and in
post-biblical Hebrew.


<b>A.3</b>  In <i>Ugaritic</i> the form <i>prqt</i> in KTU 4.205:3-4 is now thought to mean ‘loose, open, ungathered’ (of garments; cf. <i>DULAT</i><small><sup> 1</sup></small>, 681).

<b>A.4</b>  In <i>Akkadian</i> only <i>pīrqu</i> is attested, first (by metathesis from <i>paqrū</i> or <i>baqrū</i>) at Nuzi in the sense ‘vindication’, and then, more relevantly, in late Babylonian for ‘redemption’, where it is plausibly seen as an Aram. loan-word (<i>AHw</i>, 867).

<b>A.5</b>  In <i>post-biblical Hebrew</i>  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> (vowels certain?) occurs frequently
with the meanings ‘joint, limb’ (and then of comparable parts of inanimate objects), ‘section, chapter’ (of a book) and ‘(period of) time, season’.[^rcm1] A meaning ‘load’ is given for one passage (Yalk. Lam. 1000;
cf. Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1240). A different word,  <span dir="rtl">פֵּרָקוֹן</span> (Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1240), is used for ‘redemption’.

[^rcm1]: Cf. Jastrow</i>, <i>DTT</i>, 1239-40 ,for instances. The meaning ‘part, section’ is also claimed by Dupont-Sommer for some Jewish magical texts (cf. <i>DNWSI</i>, 943).

<span id="RCMA6"><b>A.6</b></span> In <i>Jewish Aramaic</i> <span dir="rtl">פִּרְקָא</span> occurs with similar meanings to  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>, but also once for a ‘cross-roads’ (Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small> Obad 1:14, based on the Heb.) and several times for a ‘session’ of a school 
(Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1240, presumably derived from the meaning ‘[period of] time’). <span dir="rtl">פִּרְקוּנָא</span> is used for ‘redemption’, and likewise  <span dir="rtl">פּוּרְקָנָא</span> (also for the payment itself).  <span dir="rtl">פַּרְקוּתָא</span> is attested once (Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small> 1 Sam 4:18, pres. in the sense ‘neck’, as in the Heb.).


<b>A.7</b>  <i>Syriac</i>: Payne Smith (<i>CSD</i>, 465) lists no less than 16 derivatives of <i>prq</i>, most of them nouns and many of them related to Christian teaching about redemption and salvation. The latter clearly reflect a post-biblical development in the language and will not be discussed in detail. Potentially older meanings are attested for 
<span dir="rtl">ܦܘܪܩܐ</span>
(<i>pūrāqā</i>), ‘looseness, division of a text’ (<i>CSD</i>, 439), 
<span dir="rtl">ܦܪܝܩܘܬܐ</span>
(<i>parīqūṯā</i>), ‘distance, separation’ (<i>CSD</i>, 460),
<span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩܐ</span>
(<i>perqā</i>), ‘piece of cloth, bandage’ (<i>CSD</i>, 465), 
<span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩܐ</span>
(<i>prāqā</i>),  ‘division, joint’ (ibid.),
<span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩܘܢܐ</span>
(<i>perqōnā</i>), ‘small piece of cloth’ (ibid.),
<span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩܬܐ</span>
(<i>pāraqṯā</i>), ‘the back of the neck’ (ibid.), 
<span dir="rtl">ܡܦܪܩܐܝܬ</span>
(<i>maprqāʾīṯ</i>, adv.), ‘at a distance’ (<i>CSD</i>, 293), and 
<span dir="rtl">ܡܦܪܩܘܬܐ</span>
(<i>maprqūṯāʾ</i>), ‘separation, removal’ (ibid.). 
It is of course possible, and even likely, that the Christian theological terms were based on an older secular (or Jewish) use of such words for ‘redemption’, as seems to be attested for other dialects of Aram. That apart, the nouns appear to refer to ‘separation’ and ‘that which has been separated from something else’ (even ‘back of the neck’ may be a specific case of the meaning ‘joint’, for which cf. <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩܐ</span>/<i>prāqāʾ</i>). The <i>CAL</i> database adds the sense ‘garment’ for <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩܐ</span> (<i>perqāʾ</i>).

## 2. Formal Characteristics

Noun: segholate, probably (cf. cognates) <i>qitl</i> (BL, §61aʺ-gʺ).

## 3. Syntagmatics


<b>A.1</b>   <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> is never the subject of a verb. It follows the adj.  <span dir="rtl">מלא</span> in
Nah 3:1, which describes a city (Nineveh, cf. 3:7).


<b>A.2</b>   <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> is preceded by the preposition  <span dir="rtl">על</span> after the verb  <span dir="rtl">עמד</span> <i>qal</i> in
Obad 1:14, which implies that it refers to a place, and the continuation
 <span dir="rtl">להכרית את־פליטיו</span> indicates that it was a place for an attack on
fugitives.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek translations 
(αʹ, σʹ)</b>:[^3]

[^3]: Aquila (αʹ) and Symmachus (σʹ) are given according to Field<sup>II</sup>.

* ἀδικία, ‘wrongdoing, iniquity’: Nah 3:1<small><sup>LXX</sup></small>;
* ἀποτομία, ‘cutting off’, or μελοκοπία, ‘mutilation’: Nah 3:1<small><sup>σʹ</sup></small>;
* διεκβολή (pl.), ‘way out’: Obad 1:14<small><sup>LXX</sup></small>;
* ἐξαυχενισμός, ‘rebellion’: Nah 3:1<small><sup>αʹ</sup></small>;
* φυγαδεία (pl.), ‘banishment, exile’: Obad 1:14<small><sup>σʹ</sup></small>.


<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܡܩܒܬܐ</span> (<i>maqqaḇṯā</i>), ‘tunnel, mine’: Obad 1:14;
* <span dir="rtl">ܥܘܠܐ</span> (<i>ʿawlā</i>), ‘iniquity, crime’: Nah 3:1.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: J)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ביזא</span>, ‘dividing, plunder, spoil’: Nah 3:1<small><sup>J</sup></small>;
* <span dir="rtl">פרקא</span>, ‘part, section’: Obad 1:14<small><sup>J</sup></small>.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>dilaceratio</i>, ‘tearing apart’: Nah 3:1;
* <i>exitus</i> (pl.), ‘way out’: Obad 1:14.


<b>A.1</b>  LXX interprets contextually with a general negative word in Nah 3:1 and this is followed closely by Pesh. Its διεκβολή in Obad 1:14 could mean (LSJ, 423) either ‘mountain-pass’ (cf. Pesh) or ‘exit from a city’ (cf. Vg).

<b>A.2</b>  Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small> ‘plunder’ and Vg ‘tearing apart’ in Nah 3:1 interpret more precisely and in ways that correspond to meanings of the verb <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>. Vg uses <i>lacero</i> to render the verb 
<span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in Ps 7:3 and the presence of the root
<span dir="rtl">טרף</span> in close proximity both here and there may have contributed to its interpretation (perhaps with help from Aquila and Symmachus, which point to wounding).

<b>A.3</b>  At Obad 1:14 Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small> renders with the Aram. equivalent, which generally means ‘part, section’ (cf. above 
<a href="#RCMA6">Root and Comparative Material A.6</a>),
a meaning that scarcely fits the context: but Cathcart and Gordon (1989:101) give ‘at the crossroads’ here.


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields


<b>A.1</b>  In Nah 3:1 <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> occurs in close proximity to expressions for hostility (<span dir="rtl">דמים</span>,  <span dir="rtl">כחשׁ</span>) and especially with the noun <span dir="rtl">טֶרֶף</span>, which is used metaphorically both here and in the two preceding verses (2:13-14) to refer to the Assyrians’ captured treasures. In 2:13 <span dir="rtl">טֶרֶף</span> is the object of <span dir="rtl">מלא</span> <i>piel</i>, just as <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> is governed by the adj. <span dir="rtl">מלא</span> here. Elsewhere
the object of <span dir="rtl">מלא</span> (as a verb) is, <i>inter alia</i>, <span dir="rtl">חָמָס</span>, ‘violence’ (Ezek 7:23), and <span dir="rtl">מֻטֶּה</span>, ‘perversion (of justice?)’ (Ezek 9:9), both with <span dir="rtl">עיר</span> as subject as here.

<b>A.2</b>  The phrases which occur in close proximity to <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> in Obad 1:14 are less informative. The combination of  <span dir="rtl">עמד</span> <i>qal</i> with <span dir="rtl">על</span> is frequent and used in a variety of contexts, but 1 Kgs 20:38 (<span dir="rtl">על־הדרך</span>) and Jer 6:16
(<span dir="rtl">על־דרכים</span>, cf. NRSV ‘crossroads’) may have particular relevance. <span dir="rtl">כרת</span> <i>hiph.</i> seems not to be used elsewhere with  <span dir="rtl">פליט</span>, but the latter is found
with the similar <span dir="rtl">נכה</span> <i>hiph.</i> in narrative contexts (Josh 8:22; Judg 12:4-5, located at <span dir="rtl">מעברות הירדן</span>, ‘the fords of the Jordan’), and Ezek 7:16 speaks of <span dir="rtl">פליטים</span> taking refuge in the mountains (<span dir="rtl">הרים</span>).


## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b>  Commentators and translations generally adopt different meanings for the two occurrences of this word, although both have a context of war. Obad 1:14 is part of a passage which is critical of the behaviour of the Edomites after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians, and <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> is understood to mean a place where the Edomites waited (in ambush?) to capture the fleeing inhabitants. Both Bewer (1911:27, 42) and Wolff (1977:37) waver between
‘breaches (in the wall of the city)’ and ‘parting of the ways’,[^ex1] citing versional and etymological support for these renderings (on the translation and textual note, see B.1 below).

[^ex1]: For the latter, cf. BDB, 830; Marti 1904:236; van Hoonacker 1908:306-07 (cf. Arab. <i>frq</i>, <i>fariq</i>).


<b>A.2</b>  Neither Smith (1911:334-35, 355) nor Rudolph (1975:174-76) has any doubt about the meaning ‘plunder’ in Nah 3:1; in favour of it they cite the accusations in 2:10, 12-13 and parallels in Assyrian and Old
Testament sources. Rudolph draws attention to the use of the verb in Ps 7:3 to refer to the action of a wild animal.

<b>B.1</b>  Rudolph deduced the meaning ‘narrow pass’ (which Marti had also considered) for Obad 1:14 from the sense ‘split’ which he (mistakenly) attributed to the verb  <span dir="rtl">פָּרַק</span>, thinking of a point of entry to the Edomite mountains. LXX and Vg, which he also cited, scarcely support this meaning and it is also contrary to the impression given by v. 13 that the Edomites are being criticised for activities in the vicinity of Jerusalem itself.

<b>B.2</b>  Wolff translated  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> as ‘way of escape’ (1977:15), which might be an acceptably imprecise way of showing his uncertainty between the two senses mentioned under A.1 (above). But his attempt to give an etymological justification for this, based on the occurrence of the verb  <span dir="rtl">פָּרַק</span> in Gen 27:40, in a meaning ‘Ausschliff’ (‘escape route’?), is only very loosely related to that passage. Renkema (2003:182-83) similarly
renders with ‘the escape route’ and provides a full discussion of the evidence, including the descriptions of similar perils for fugitives in Lam 4:18-19, 5:8-9. But his attempts to bolster the case for his
translation with ‘the notion of division contained in the verb
<span dir="rtl">פרק</span>’ and the (mis)interpretation of <span dir="rtl">פֹּרֵק</span> in Lam 5:8 as meaning ‘to escape’ (183 n. 282) are based on fragile foundations.


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>  There is no doubt about the meaning ‘plunder’ in Nah 3:1 and it fits well with the idea of ‘violent removal’ which is common in uses of the related Heb. verb.

<b>A.2</b>  In Obad 1:14 the exact meaning remains uncertain. Modern commentators generally see <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span> as a word for a place, and this has the support of the ancient Versions and, at first sight, the context. More specific interpretations such as ‘breach’ or ‘fork’ (on a road) can appeal to meanings of cognates in other languages, but they do not easily
correlate with clearly attested meanings of the verb <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in BHeb. Perhaps it would be best to understand the word here in the sense which it has in Nah 3:1, i.e. ‘plunder’. The Edomites are then accused of waiting by
piles of what they had taken from the city (cf. v. 13) to take prisoner the fleeing inhabitants.
