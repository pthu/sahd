### Text Doubtful

In Nah 3:9  <span dir="rtl">בְּעֶזְרָתֵךְ</span> (with sf. 2 fem.sg.) is often emended to <span dir="rtl">בְּעֶזְרָתָהּ</span> (with sf. 3 fem.sg.; see LXX, Pesh, <i>BHS</i>, and many modern commentaries), but it is possible to maintain MT (<i>BHQ</i>).



### Qere/Ketiv 

Ezek 12:14 K  <span dir="rtl">עזרה</span> Q  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרוֹ</span>; or emend to  <span dir="rtl">עֹזְרָיו</span>, ‘his helpers’ (cf.
<i>BHS</i>), following LXX, Pesh and Tg.


## 1. Root And Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> [See  <span dir="rtl">עָזַר</span> R&C]


## 2. Formal Characteristics


<b>A.1</b>  <i>qitl</i>/<i>qitlat</i> form, in which the <i>seghol</i> appears after a guttural
(Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, § 97Aa).


<b>A.2</b>  The form  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָתָה</span> in Pss 44:27, 63:8, and 94:17 appears only these
three times in BHeb. (cf. <i>masorah parva</i>) and once in 4Q160 fr3-4ii:2. It
appears to have the old accusative ending, particularly frequent with
feminine nouns. The absence of the definite article may indicate the
antiquity of the phenomenon (Hurvitz 1985:116–19), although this is not
conclusive (Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §93j n. 1). This form with feminine
nouns only appears in poetry (Tsevat 1955:21–22) and it may have been
chosen to avoid the contact of two successive stressed syllables
(Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §93j). Sawyer suggests that it has a quasi-verbal
function (1982:1042 [1990:447]).  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָת</span>, found in absolute state in Ps 60:13=108:13, is an alternative form with another variant ending of this noun (GK, §80g).

## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is the subject of the verb  <span dir="rtl">היה</span>, ‘to be’ (4Q160 fr3-4ii:2).


<b>A.2</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is the direct object of  <span dir="rtl">יהב</span>, ‘to give’ (Pss 60:13; 108:13),
and  <span dir="rtl">ראה</span>, ‘to see’ (Job 31:21).


<b>A.3</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is found as the predicate of  <span dir="rtl">אֱלֹהִים</span>, ‘God’ (Ps 46:2; 4Q381
fr24a+b:8), and of  <span dir="rtl">יהוה</span>, ‘LORD’ (Ps 94:17), and – with the verb  <span dir="rtl">היה</span>, ‘to
be’ – of ‘you’ (= God; Pss 27:9; 63:8).


<b>A.4</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is found as the <i>nomen regens</i> of  <span dir="rtl">יהוה</span>, ‘LORD’ (Judg 5:23;
2x),
<span dir="rtl">פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן</span>,
‘doers of evil’ (Isa 31:2),
<span dir="rtl">יכה</span>]<span dir="rtl">פנ</span>,
‘your face’, or
<span dir="rtl">עליכה</span>]<span dir="rtl">פו</span>, ‘your works’ (1QM 13:14, reconstr. uncertain), and  <span dir="rtl">בני חושׁך</span>,
‘sons of darkness (1QM 16:11).


<b>A.5</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is followed by the preposition  <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, ‘in’ or ‘with’ (Job
6:13), indicating the source of help, and also in Judg 5:23; Ps 46:2 and
Job 31:21, referring to the situation in which help is required.


<b>A.6</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is followed by  <span dir="rtl">מִן</span>, ‘from’ +  <span dir="rtl">צָר</span>, ‘trouble’ (Ps
60:13=108:13).


<b>A.7</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is preceded by the preposition  <span dir="rtl">אֵל</span>, ‘unto’ (Lam 4:17).


<b>A.8</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is preceded by the preposition  <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> (<i>beth essentiae</i>) +  <span dir="rtl">היה</span>,
‘to be’ (Nah 3:9),  <span dir="rtl">קוּם</span> +, ‘to rise up as’ (Ps 35:2), and +  <span dir="rtl">יפע</span> <i>hiph.</i>,
‘to shine forth as’ (1QM 1:16). For a different account of the use of
 <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> in such expressions, see Brockelmann 1956, §106g.


<b>A.9</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is governed by the prepositions  <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, ‘because of’ (1QM
13:13, with  <span dir="rtl">גיל</span>, ‘to rejoice’), and  <span dir="rtl">כְּ</span>, ‘like’ (1QM 13:14).


<b>A.10</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> sometimes follows a verb and the preposition  <span dir="rtl">לְ</span>, to express
the purpose of seeking help, e.g.  +  <span dir="rtl">נוּס</span>, ‘to flee to ... for’ (Isa
10:3; 20:6),  <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> +
<span dir="rtl">ירד</span>, ‘to go down ... for’ (Isa 31:1).


<b>A.11</b>  When governed by the preposition  <span dir="rtl">לְ</span>,  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> frequently follows
verbs of motion and can itself have a verbal quality like that of an
infinitive construct, to express the intention of helping, e.g.,
+ <span dir="rtl">בּוֹא</span>,
‘to come ... to help’ (Judg 5:23), + <span dir="rtl">יָצָא</span> , ‘to go out ... for’ (Jer
37:7);  <span dir="rtl">חושׁ</span> + paragogic <i>hē</i>, ‘to rush ... to’ (Pss 22:20; 38:23; 40:14;
70:2; 71:12 [Qere]; cf. 2 Chron 28:21).


<span id="SyntA12"><b>A.12</b></span>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is also used with a quasi-verbal sense without the
preposition  <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> following a verb of motion, e.g.  <span dir="rtl">קוּם</span> + paragogic <i>hē</i>,
‘to rise up’ (Ps 44:27).


<b>A.13</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is the (logical) object of  <span dir="rtl">קוּם</span> +  <span dir="rtl">עַל</span>, ‘to rise up ...
against’ (Isa 31:2).


<b>A.14</b>   <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is found with the particle  <span dir="rtl">כל</span>, ‘all/any’ (4Q372 fr1:18).


<b>B.1</b>  Dahood proposes that the presence of the preposition  <span dir="rtl">מִן</span> in Ps
60:13=108:13 indicates that  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> in these instances (and  <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span> at
Deut 33:7) denotes ‘liberation’ (1970:95-96; 1973:82). Dahood compares it to
Ug. <i>wyʿdrk byd</i> … (<i>KTU</i> 1.18.I:14), which he translates as ‘to liberate you from the hand of …’, although the translation ‘and let him <i>help</i> you from the hand of …’ is more common.
In this phrase, <i>wyʿdrk</i> occurs in parallel with
<i>yplṭk</i> (from <i>plṭ</i>,
‘to deliver’). Dahood (1970:95) argues that in a similar manner to the
verb  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> having two meanings, ‘to help’ and ‘to rescue’, Ug. <i>ʿdr</i> and
Heb.  <span dir="rtl">עזר</span> normally signify ‘to help’ or ‘help’, but with certain
prepositions denote ‘to rescue, liberate from’. Dahood gives further
examples of this phenomenon, although it might be noted that the
Ugaritic – along with Sir 51:2–3 and 1QH 10:36-37 (old numbering:
2:34–35) that he cites in support – all include the noun <i>yd</i>/<span dir="rtl">יד</span> with the
preposition. The immediate context of Ps 60=108 is a request for God’s
presence and help in battle rather than removal from it. It thus
suggests that  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> has the sense of divine presence providing
protection from enemies (cf. the use of  <span dir="rtl">עזר</span> +  <span dir="rtl">מִן</span> in Ezra 8:22).

<b>A.1</b> The primary translation is that of ‘help’ in LXX (βοήθεια and
ἀντιλαμβάνομαι with cognates), Pesh (ܥܕܪ/<i>ʿdr</i> and cognates), Tg ( <span dir="rtl">סעד</span> and
 <span dir="rtl">סיע</span> with cognates), and Vg (<i>auxilior</i> and <i>adiuvo</i> with cognates).

<b>A.2</b> In Ps 22[21]:20 LXX ἀντίλημψις may have been chosen to represent
 <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> since βοήθεια had been used earlier in the verse for  <span dir="rtl">אֱיָלוּת</span>.
Ἀντίλημψις (see Margolis 1972 for Hebrew equivalents), a later form of
ἀντίληψις, is derived from ἀντιλαμβάνομαι, ‘to help, take part with,
assist’ (LSJ, 157), or ‘to come to the assistance of’ (Lev 25:35; <i>GELS</i>,
59). The noun in <i>koine</i> often denotes ‘defence, succour’ (LSJ, 158; cf.
LEH, 55), and is attested with such a meaning in papyri, the LXX and the
NT. See <i>defensio</i>, ‘defence’, as translation of LXX’s ἀντίλημψις in
Vg<small><sup>PsG</sup></small> Ps 22[21]:20.

<b>A.3</b> Vg’s unique choice of <i>profuit</i>, ‘it was useful, of benefit’, for
 <span dir="rtl">לְעֶזְרָה</span> in 2 Chron 28:21 may result from the subject of the clause
being (or being seen as) impersonal. In Job 31:21 <i>cum viderem me in
porta superiorem</i>, ‘when I saw myself superior in the gate’, is a
paraphrase which specifies the result of the speaker having help
( <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָתִי</span>) as superiority in a legal dispute, rather than representing
precisely the meaning of the original.

<b>A.4</b> The Peshitta at Ps 108:13 has ܚܝܠܐ (<i>ḥaylā</i>), ‘power’, for  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָת</span>,
whereas in the identical Ps 60:13 it has ܥܘܕܪܢܐ (<i>ʿuḏrānā</i>), ‘help’. The
translator knew what  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָת</span> meant, but evidently decided here to
specify the kind of help that was needed in a military crisis (compare
the occasional use of ἰσχύς for  <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span> and of ἰσχύω and compounds for
<span dir="rtl">עזר</span>). In 2 Chron 28:21, as in the previous verse, the translator has
rewritten his original in the light of the context (28:16-20).
For
<span dir="rtl">וְלֹא לְעֶזְרָה לוֹ</span>
he has put
<span dir="rtl">ܕܠܐ ܢܗܪܝܘܗܝ</span>
(<i>dlʾ nhrywhy</i>,
followed by 
<span dir="rtl">ܒܙܒܢܐ ܕܐܘܠܨܢܗ</span> / 
<i>bzbnʾ dʾwlṣnh</i>), ‘so that he would not harm him (in a time of
trouble)’. The final words are taken from the beginning of 28:22 and are
made to refer back to the Edomite and Philistine attacks in 28:17-19.
Then instead of reporting the failure of Ahaz’s approach to
Tiglath-pileser with MT (with its echo of 28:16), the translator
explains its intention in a <i>d</i>-clause, in effect seeing the ‘help’ sought
(and not provided) as the avoidance of harm. In both verses, therefore,
the Peshitta provides no direct evidence for the meaning of  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span>.

<b>A.5</b> In all the Versions verbs are used to render  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> on several
occasions.

<b>B.1</b> Job 6:13 appears in the LXX to be a paraphrase of the sense of the
Hebrew. πείθω, ‘to trust (in)’, provides the rendering ‘Did I not trust
in him?’ (NETS) in place of the Hebrew ‘My help is not in me’. It should
be noted, however, that the noun in parallelism  <span dir="rtl">תֻּשִׁיָּה</span>, ‘effective
aid’, is translated by βοήθεια, the most frequent equivalent for
 <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span>. The LXX could be justification for emending  <span dir="rtl">תֻּשִׁיָּה</span> to
 <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, but it is not necessary.

<b>B.2</b> The LXX rendering ἐλπίς (Isa 31:2) appears in a translation of the
Hebrew phrase ‘the help(ers) of those who perform iniquity’. The LXX
appears to have understood this passage as simply ‘their vain hope’,
omitting the verb  <span dir="rtl">פָּעַל</span>. The difference between the Hebrew and Greek is
great enough for no reliable semantic information to be drawn from the
version to this verse.

<span id="LexSem"></span>
## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<span id="LexSemA1"><b>A.1</b></span>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is found in parallelism with  <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to deliver’ (Pss
40:14; 70:2),  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, ‘help’ (Ps 60:13=108:13),  <span dir="rtl">תֻּשִׁיָּה</span>, ‘wisdom’
(Job 6:13), and  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to save’ (Lam 4:17). It is joined by <i>waw</i> to
 <span dir="rtl">פלט</span> <i>pi.</i> part., ‘deliverer’ (Ps 40:18).

<b>A.2</b> It occurs in close collocation with the verbs  <span dir="rtl">קוּם</span>, ‘to rise up’,
 <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, ‘to set free’ (Ps 44:27),  <span dir="rtl">נוּס</span>, ‘to flee’ (Isa 10:3; 20:6),
<span dir="rtl">נצל</span dir="rtl">
<i>hiph.</i>, ‘to deliver’ (Isa 20:6), and  <span dir="rtl">מלט</span> <i>niph.</i>, ‘escape’ (Isa 20:6), and
with the nouns  <span dir="rtl">עֹצֶם</span>, ‘might’ (Nah 3:9),  <span dir="rtl">כֹּחַ</span>, ‘strength’ (Job
6:12-13),  <span dir="rtl">אֱיָלוּת</span>, ‘help’ (Ps 22:20),  <span dir="rtl">יֵשַׁע</span> in  <span dir="rtl">אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׁעִי</span>, ‘God
of my salvation’ (Ps 27:9),  <span dir="rtl">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>, ‘salvation’ (Ps 38:23),  <span dir="rtl">מַחֲסֶה</span>,
‘refuge’, and  <span dir="rtl">עֹז</span>, ‘strength’ (Ps 46:2).

<span id="LexSemA3"><b>A.3</b></span> Antonyms, such as  <span dir="rtl">עזב</span>,  <span dir="rtl">נטשׁ</span>,  <span dir="rtl">רחק מן</span> and  <span dir="rtl">הסתיר פנים</span>, occur in the
often repetitive Psalms contexts in which  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> appears (e.g., Pss
22:20; 27:9; 71:12; 94:14-17).

<b>A.4</b> Lipiński (1989:17) argues that  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is synonymous with  <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span>, and
that this is indicated by their both being found with the syntagm
<span dir="rtl">מִצָּר</span dir="rtl">
(Deut 33:7; Pss 60:13; 108:13). The variant reading  <span dir="rtl">עזרה</span> for  <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span> in
1QIsa<sup>a</sup> at 30:5 gives additional support to this view. These nouns do
differ in distribution, nonetheless, since the feminine form is found
primarily in poetry.

<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is absent from the Pentateuch and is found primarily in
poetry (Judg 5 is a poetic composition). It is most frequent in the
Psalms (14x). In this it can be contrasted to  <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span>, which is well
attested in the Pentateuch and historical books, as well as being found
in the Psalms and Latter Prophets.


<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span>, like  <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span> and the associated verb  <span dir="rtl">עזר</span>, is used of divine
and human assistance in both military and non-military contexts. This
will be shown in A.3-6.


<b>A.3</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> ‘human help in everyday life’   
There appear to be only two examples, although one might have expected
this to be the most common use of the word.   
In Job 31:21 Job speaks of his ‘help(er) in the gate’, which probably
means someone who would support him in a legal dispute. Since the other
party is a  <span dir="rtl">יתום</span>, ‘orphan’, Job must imagine himself to be using such
support to take advantage of the weak (contrast 29:12, where  <span dir="rtl">עֹזֵר</span> is
used and the context may also be judicial).   
In Job 6:13  <span dir="rtl">האם</span> is difficult (see the commentaries) and perhaps corrupt.
With reference to Num 17:28 <i>BHS</i> suggests that it could mean ‘truly’. The
phrase  <span dir="rtl">אין עזרתי בי</span> implies that Job is searching for help to survive
within himself, i.e., in his own strength, but cannot find any.


<b>A.4</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> ‘human help as national political and military support’   
In a number of texts,  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> describes the kind of support given from
one nation to another in times of crisis such as military attack (e.g.,
Isa 10:3; 20:6; 31:1; Jer 37:7).  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> is sometimes used to describe
the nation giving such support, defining a particular political or
military ally. The relational nature of this usage is marked by
pronominal suffixes, e.g., in Nah 3:9 and Lam 4:17.   
<span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> can even denote help (not) given to God in a military situation
(Judg 5:23; cf.  <span dir="rtl">גבורים</span>), or the help of a people that is not needed by
God because he is  <span dir="rtl">גבור</span>, and even his ‘finger’ is stronger than any human
foe (4Q372 fr1:18).


<b>A.5</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> ‘divine help in everyday life’   
God’s help is frequently sought or welcomed by individuals in their
struggles with their personal ‘enemies’ (e.g., Pss 22:20; 27:9; 35:2;
38:23; 63:8; 4Q381 fr24a+b:8). Sometimes the enemies are explicitly
identified as accusers (Ps 71:12) or hostile rulers (Ps 94:17).


<b>A.6</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> ‘divine help as national political and military support’   
In the Psalms the nation seeks or rejoices in God’s help against enemy
forces (Pss 44:27; 46:2; 60:13=108:13); similarly in the Qumran War
Scroll the sectarian ‘sons of light’ rely on God’s help (1QM 1:16;
13:13, 14), while Belial girds himself to bring help to the ‘sons of
darkness’ in the eschatological battle (1QM 16:11).


<span id="ExA7"><b>A.7</b></span> The help given is sometimes support of an undefined kind, whether
military (Judg 5:23; Isa 31:1, 2; Jer 37:7; 1QM as above) or not (Ps
94:17; Job 31:21), but frequently it takes the form of rescue from
danger (Isa 20:6; Pss 22:20; 35:2; 38:23, etc.; Lam 4:17) or the
provision of a safe refuge (Isa 10:3; 20:6; Pss 27:9; 46:2, etc.).
Occasionally there is an indication that ‘strength’ is meant (Nah 3:9;
Ps 46:2; Job 6:13; 4Q381 fr24a+b:8). It is from the surrounding context
that it is often possible to deduce that the assistance takes the form
of rescue, refuge, protection or strengthening. However, this does not
change the meaning of the word, only its reference. In almost all cases
the help is needed in a situation of conflict or danger, even though the
meaning and potential use of the word is much broader.


<b>A.8</b>  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> denotes active support which requires the proximity of the
helper: the frequency with which it follows a verb of motion plus the
preposition  <span dir="rtl">ל</span> reflects this (Judg 5:23; Jer 37:7; Pss 22:20; 38:23;
40:14; 70:2; 71:12; 94:17; 2 Chron 28:21; 1QM 16:11; cf. Ps 44:27 with
paragogic <i>hē</i>). In these cases the noun is virtually equivalent to the
infinitive of the verb. This is a distinctive use of  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> which is
not shared by  <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span>.


<b>A.9</b>  Several times  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> has a personal sense, ‘help<i>er</i>(s)’, like the
participle of the verb: Isa 31:2; Nah 3:9; Pss 27:9; 40:18; 46:2; 63:8;
94:17; Job 31:21; Lam 4:17; 1QM 1:16(?); 4Q160 fr3-4ii:2; 4Q381
fr24a+b:8).


<b>A.10</b> Sometimes the help denoted by  <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span> does not materialise, namely
when it comes from Assyria (Isa 20:6), Egypt (Isa 31:1, contrasted with
going to God), or an unnamed nation (Lam 4:17).


<b>A.11</b>  Perhaps because of its concentration in the Psalms, it is more
frequently associated with other ‘salvation’ lexemes (<span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> <i>hiph.</i>,
 <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i>,  <span dir="rtl">פלט</span> <i>pi.</i>; see 
 <a href="#LexSemA1">Lexical/Semantic Fields A.1, A.2</a>) than is <span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span>.

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">עֶזְרָה</span>, like the other words in the ‘help’ group, is essentially a
general word for ‘support, assistance’, as can be seen from some
examples of its use, both military (Judg 5:23; Isa 31:1, 2; Jer 37:7; 2
Chron 28:21; 1QM 1:16; 13:13, 14; 16:11) and non-military (Ps 94:17; Job
31:21; 4Q160 fr3-4ii:2; 4Q372 fr1:18).


<b>A.2</b>  As such it is closest in meaning to expressions like  <span dir="rtl">טֹובָה</span> and
 <span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>, which like it have a strongly active component but are not tied
to a specific kind of benefit to others. Antonyms are words or phrases
which are equivalent to ‘not to help’, such as  <span dir="rtl">עזב</span>,  <span dir="rtl">נטשׁ</span>,  <span dir="rtl">רחק מן</span> and
 <span dir="rtl">הסתיר פנים</span>, which occur in the often repetitive Psalms contexts (see
<a href="#LexSemA3">Lexical/Semantic Fields A.3</a>).


<b>A.3</b>  This will also be its meaning in most, perhaps all, contexts which
are concerned with rescue, refuge or strength (see <a href="#ExA7">Exegesis A.7</a>).
Its association with other words from the ‘deliverance’ field (see
<a href="#LexSem">Lexical/Semantic Fields</a>) does not (usually) lead to its becoming a
synonym of them, rather it presents a different, broader perspective on
the intervention that is looked for or experienced, a perspective which
may be more relational in character.


<b>A.4</b>  The possible exceptions are in Ps 60:13 and Ps 108:13 (where two
different introductions lead into what is essentially the same text): in
each case the tight syntagm  <span dir="rtl">עזרת</span> plus  <span dir="rtl">מצר</span> follows the imperative  <span dir="rtl">הבה</span> and
the sense ‘release’ might seem to be appropriate, especially with
 <a href="/words/thshu3ah/"><span dir="rtl">תשׁועה</span></a> in the parallel stich. But if so, this probably arises from the
same kind of ‘pregnant construction’ (GK, §119ee-gg) that is sometimes
found with verbs (including  <span dir="rtl">עזר</span>; see <a href="#SyntA12">Syntagmatics A.12</a> in that
entry): ‘give me help from the foe’ is shorthand for ‘give me help <i>and
deliverance</i> from the foe’, especially as ‘give me help’ is only a
transformation of the verbal form ‘help me’.
