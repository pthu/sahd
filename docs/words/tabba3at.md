## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> 
<i>Root.</i> 
Since the root is attested in both Northwest and South
Semitic languages<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:1')">1</a></sup> a Semitic
origin might be considered, but is unlikely. See below.

<a id="Eg"></a><b>A.2</b> 
<i>Egyptian.</i> 
Lambdin, Schott, Ellenbogen, Boochs and Keel<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:2')">2</a></sup> all see <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> as a loan word from Egyptian <i>ḏbʿwt</i> ‘signet ring, seal’<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:3')">3</a></sup>, which in turn is derived from Egyptian
<i>ḏbʿ</i> ‘finger’<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:4')">4</a></sup>.  Since this word is already attested during the Old Kingdom, a borrowing in the reverse direction is highly unlikely. The Hebrew verb <span dir="rtl">טבע</span> Qal ‘to sink into’, Pi./Hi. ‘immerse’, must therefore be seen as an early denominative of <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span>, just like the verb <span dir="rtl">חתם</span> from <a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jwtm.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם/חֹתֶמֶת</span></a>.

<b>A.3</b> 
<i>Coptic.</i> 
Sahidic <i>tebbe</i>, ‘seal’.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:5')">5</a></sup>

<b>A.4</b> 
<i>Akkadian.</i> 
Some authors refer to Akkad. <i>ṭimbuʾu</i>,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:6')">6</a></sup> <i>ṭimbū(t)tu</i> which would also occur in some inventories of precious items in the El Amarna letters. However, nowadays the word is transcribed as <i>tibbuttu</i> / <i>timbuttu</i>, and is thought to mean ‘cricket’, even if it is made of some kind of gemstone.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:7')">7</a></sup>

<b>A.5</b> 
<i>Phoenician, Punic.</i>
In the Phoenician  <i>KAI</i> 51:9-10 the word <i>ṭbʿt</i>  is used in broken context: <i>wḥtmm bṭbʿt</i> ‘and seal with the signet ring’. Comparable Hebrew texts from Arad  show that it was the
custom to seal jars of oil  or wine with a seal so that the contents were  garantueed and the owner known
(<a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jwtm.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם/חֹתֶמֶת</span></a>).

<a id="RL"></a><b>A.11</b> 
<i>Rabbinical Literature.</i>
According to 11Q19<sup>a</sup> (11QTemple<small><sup>a</sup></small>) xxxiv:6 young bulls are tied to apparently sturdy rings. <br>
In rabbinic Hebrew the word <span dir="rtl">טבעת</span> keeps the same meaning as in Biblical Hebrew, but could also metaphorically designate the anus.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:12')">12</a></sup> <br>
In mSoṭ. 1:6 a woman is described as wearing ornaments of gold and chains of gold
and nose rings and finger rings (<i>ṭabbaʿat</i>). In mKel. 11:8, the
word is used in an enumeration, and explained as a ring ‘with a seal or
without a seal’. mKel. 13:6 suggests that a signet ring  could consist of a ring
of metal and a seal of coral but also the other way round, a ring of coral and a
signet of metal (in the latter case it is not susceptible to uncleanness). In
mShab. 6:1, 3 it is declared that a woman may not go out bearing a ring, whether with or whithout a seal (<i>ṭabbaʿat šeʾēn ʿalehā</i>).

## <a id="AV"></a>4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions (αʹ, σʹ, θʹ)</b>:

<b>b.  Peshitta (Pesh):</b>  

* The Peshitta does not make use of the obvious Syriac cognate <i>ṭbʿʾ</i> (see <a href="#Syr">Root and Comparative Material, A.7 Syriac</a>). It distinguishes between <i>ʿzqtʾ</i> ‘ring, signet-ring’  (Gen 41:42; Exod 35:22; Num 31:50<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:15')">15</a></sup>) worn on a finger, <i>zqzqtʾ</i> ‘a ring to hold a bar or staff for carrying’ (Exod. 25:12, etc.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:16')">16</a></sup>) or to link the breast-piece of the chief priest to the ephod (Exod. 39:16, etc.), but for the latter also <i>qwrqsʾ</i> ‘ring, clasp, buckle’<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:17')">17</a></sup> could be used (Exod 28:23, 24, 27, etc.). 


<b>c. Targum (Tg):</b>

Renders invariably by <i>ʿsqh</i> ‘ring’.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:14')">14</a></sup>


<b>d.  Vulgate (Vg):</b>  

* In the texts were a real (signet) ring is meant it is translated
<i>anulus</i>, in the texts about the tabernacle it is rendered as
<i>circulus</i>.

## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Literal Use


<b>A.1</b>
In Gen 41:42 Pharaoh takes his <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> from his own hand and puts it on Joseph’s hand. In the parallel line he clothes Joseph in  ‘fine linen’ (<span dir="rtl">בִּגְדֵי&thinsp;־שֵׁשׁ</span>) and puts a gold chain (<span dir="rtl">רְבִד הַזָּהָב</span>) around his neck. Apparently, this was an official ritual, a legal
act belonging to an inauguration. It symbolised the transfer of power from a higher to a lower authority. A similar enactment ritual is
described in 1 Macc 6:15: the Syrian Philip is entrusted
with the king’s diadem, robe and signet ring [δακτύλιος], and made a ‘king maker’. See also <i>ANET</i>, 295, 
where Assurbanipal appoints Necho as Egyptian viceroy
by giving him a special garment, a golden chain and rings on his hands.  
With the king’s signet ring Joseph was able to sign in the name of the king. Another
bestowal with a signet ring is described in Est 3:10  where king
Ahasuerus gives his ring to Haman, after the latter has requested permission to kill all
Jews in the country. In Est 3:12 a decree is written against the Jews and signed (<span dir="rtl">חתם</span> Nif.) by Haman with the king’s signet ring <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span>. Such a privilege was granted conditionally, however. When Ahasuerus realised  how wicked Haman’s plan was, he had the ring removed from Haman  (<span dir="rtl">עבר</span> Hif.) and started to wear it himself again until he gave it to Mordecai (Est 8:2). According to Est 8:8, 10  Esther and Mordecai write a decree concerning the Jews and seal itwith the king’s signet ring. A decree, sealed with the signet ring of the king,
was irrevocable (<span dir="rtl">לְהָשִׁיב</span> <span dir="rtl">אֵין</span>, Est 8:8). 

<b>A.2</b>
This background of the transfer of power by means of a ring lends special meaning to Luke 15:22: the father not merely clothes the prodigal son well after his return, but transfers his authority  to the youngest instead of the oldest son.

<b>A.3</b>
Because the same transfer of power by means of a signet ring is attested for <a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jwtm.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם</span></a>, there cannot have existed a major difference between the two types of seals. The Egyptian word <i>ḏbʿwt</i> from which <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> seems to be derived (see <a href="#Eg">Root and Comparative Material, A.2 Egyptian</a>) can also denote a cylinder seal.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:18')">18</a></sup> Because most of the texts in which <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> occurs are generally dated rather late<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:19')">19</a></sup> and <span dir="rtl">טבעת</span> does not occur in epigraphical Hebrew from the time of the monarchy, it is possible that <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> started to supersede <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם</span> as a general term for the signet ring in later Biblical Hebrew. The circumstance that <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם</span> denotes a signet ring in the late text Hag 2:23 can be explained by the intended allusion to Jer 22:24. Exod 28:11, 21, 36; 39:6, 14, 30 create the impression that by the time of their composition <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם</span> was reserved for the gemstone whereas  <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> that occurs in the same chapters denoted any ring-shaped object.

<b>A.4</b>
Just as in Egypt and Mesopotamia<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:20')">20</a></sup> rings were suitable as votive gifts to the deity. In Exod 35:22 all people volunteer to bring ‘all their gold objects’ (<span dir="rtl">כָּל־כּלִי זָהָב</span>) as a  tribute for the building and the service of the
tabernacle. Among the jewelry were rings (<span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span>). Here, in one colon, brooches, earrings, signet rings and armlets are listed. The conjunctive accents show that signet rings and armlets form a word
pair (<span dir="rtl">וְכוּמָז</span> <span dir="rtl">וְטַבַּעַת</span>). After a siege the people thank God by offering him articles of gold
(<span dir="rtl">כְּלִי&thinsp;־זָהָב</span>, Num 31:50). In this text in one colon armlets, bracelets and signet rings (<span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> <span dir="rtl">וְצָמִיד</span> <span dir="rtl">אֶצְעָדָה</span>) are mentioned. Apparently all three kinds of jewelry were worn on the arm and/or hand. Only in the next colon earrings and beads are listed.  

<b>A.5</b>
Schroer doubts whether it is correct to designate this jewelry as votive gifts, because the rings would be melted to 
reuse them for the building of the tabernacle.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:21')">21</a></sup> 
However, Num 31:54 creates the definite impression that at least some of the precious objects remained unmelted in the tabernacle, as a memorial.
If also signet rings
were among the precious articles, as seems natural to suppose, the author appears to assume that also ordinary people could own
seals set in gold, silver or bronze זָהָב וָכֶסֶף וּנְחֹשֶׁת (Exod 35:4-5), but he may have thought of the gold and silver the Egyptians gave them according to Exod 3:22; 11:2; 12:35-36.

<b>A.6</b>
The word <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> occurs most frequently in the tabernacletexts as metal rings, circular fittings used as holders for poles or bars (Exod 25:12, 14,
15, 26, 27; 25:27; 26:24, 29; 27:4, 7; 30:4; 36:29, 34; 37:3, 5, 13, 14, 27;
38:5, 7). The context shows that fairly large rings were intended which were always attached to something, presumably by a circular base, so that their outer shape resembled that of a big signet ring. The word is used also in texts describing the garment of the
chief priest. In Exod 28:23-24 and Exod 39:16, 17, 19, rings are made for the
breastpiece of the ephod. Two cords of gold were threaded through the two rings (Exod
28:24; 39:17). Two other rings were made of gold for the shoulder pieces of the
ephod (Exod 28:26, 27; Exod 39:20). The rings of the breastpiece were to be
tied to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband
(Exod 28:28; 39:21). Since the breastpiece  with all its precious stones and gold was a very heavy object, the rings must have been imagined as rather sturdy objects.


### 6.2 Figurative Use

<b>A.1</b> 
Not attested, unless one regards the rings on the ark, the breastpiece and the ephod as metaphors derived from the shape of a signet ring. Just as a personal name was derived from the precious object <a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jwtm.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם</span></a>, so <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> inspired the PN <span dir="rtl">טַבָּעֹות</span> ‘Ringlets’, possibly because of the person’s curls.


### 6.3 Pictorial Material

<b>A.1</b> 
Nice example of a woman’s signet ring: Deutsch 2003.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#footnote" data-toggle="modal" onclick="show_modal('fn:22')">22</a></sup>



### 6.4 Archaeology

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
In contrast to the more general term <a href=http://otw-site.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jwtm.pdf target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">חֹותָם/חֹתֶמֶת</span></a> the word <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> specifically refers to a ring, either the signet ring, or a more sturdy type which could hold carrying poles or restrain young bulls. Only the Peshitta tries to differentiate between these types. Even though it may be an old loan word from Egyptian, it is attested only in late Biblical Hebrew. 

<b>A.2</b>
Several times <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> is used to designate a king’s signet ring (Gen 41:42; Est 3:12; 8:2, 8, 10), but also ordinary people, men and women, could wear a <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span> (Exod 35:22; Num 31:40) though the contextgives no clue as to its use, both a simple ring to enhance one’s beauty (so possibly Isa 3:21)  as well as a signet ring
might be meant. These rings were made of gold, silver or bronze (Exod
34:5). The transfer of power in connection with the investiture of a king or a high officer was often represented symbolically by handing over a signet ring.
