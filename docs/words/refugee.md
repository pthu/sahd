## Introduction

Grammatical Type: n m.

Occurrences: Total 19x OT, 0x Sir, 1x Qum (4Q217 fr12.3; plus Is 45.20
written as MT in 1QIsa^(a)), 0x inscr.

Text Doubtful:

**A.1**  Licht (1957:100) restored ט[פלי] in 1QH 5.6. Delcor (1962:156)
rejects this restoration, though Vermes (1997:267) translates the term
“[deliverance]” and thus suggests a restoration similar to that of
Licht: probably pallēṭ (infinitive piel). The reading here is too
isolated and uncertain to be of semantic use.

**A.2**  The occurrence of י]ט[י]פל in 4Q217 12.3 is almost certain, and is
adopted by DJD (XIII:32). This should probably be taken as pālīṭ rather
than pālēṭ because of the plene spelling and because the phraseology
with שׁוב ‘return’ seems closer to Jr 44.28 than to Jr 44.14b.

**B.1**  BHS Ezk 24.27 suggests that אֶת־הַפָּלִיט may have been added, although
this suggestion has no direct textual support, and there is no obvious
process for the addition of this phrase to take place.

**B.2**  BHS Jdg 12.4 claims that much of v. 4b, including פָּלִיט, was not
represented in the earliest form of the LXX, but this not semantically
relevant.

Qere/Ketiv: none.

## 1. Root and Comparative Material

**A.1**  See פלט Qal.

**A.2**  Ben-Hayyim (1957:559) attests פליט in Samaritan Hebrew.

**A.3**  GenR 42.8 on Gn 14.13 uses פָּלִיט.

**B.1**  Hubbard (1997:623) says that פָּלִיט “comes from” the adjective
פָּלֵיט(written with short “a”), though there is no evidence for this.

## 2. Formal Characteristics

**A.1**  Hasel (1989:593 = 2001:555) says that the form פָּלִיט “entstammt einer
Adjektivform”, and defines it as a qati:l form (thus also HAL:880a).
Barth (1894:§125e) states that this qati:l form is an active participle
from an i-imperfect verb (the i-imperfect is attested in the proper name
יַפְלֵט [1Ch 7.32, 33]). In contrast to Barth, Waltke & O’Connor (1990:88,
§5.3c) suggest that in the case of פָּלִיט the form has a passive sense.

**A.1**  Each version shows a preference for a particular root in its own
language. The LXX generally translates the lexeme by a compound of or
cognate of σῴζω ‘save’. Sym usually translates by a compound of φεύγω
‘flee’. Pesh, when not translating by cognate ʾtplṭ, most often uses
ʾtpṣy ‘be delivered’. Tg generally uses שׁיזב and cognates, and Vg *fug-
based words. The impression of meaning from all the versions is that the
lexeme means “one who is saved through flight”. In addition there is
some variation between translation equivalents that present the escape
or flight as in the past, and those that present it in the present.

**A.2**  The possible exceptions, where the meaning given is more negative,
are מְעָרְקוֹהִי in Tg at Ob 14 (‘fugitives, refugees’) and in Vg fugitivus
and some or all of the forms of fugio, ‘flee’, where there is no
guarantee of a positive outcome.

**A.3**  The versions reveal no obvious distinction between פָּלִיט and פָּלֵט.

**B.1**  LXX in Ezk 33.22 uses αὐτόν to refer back to its rendering of פָּלִיט
in v. 21 to avoid repetition.

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Field(s)

**A.1**  For a discussion of the semantic field of lexemes of the root פלט,
and for a contrast of these lexemes with those of the root מלט see
Lexical/Semantic Field(s) of פלט piel.

**A.2**  It has been suggested by Zorell (651a) that פָּלֵט supplies the
absolute pl of פָּלִיט, which only occurs in the absolute sing, construct
pl and suffixed pl. However, this distribution may be merely a
by-product of the fundamental difference these lexemes display, despite
some overlap in meaning. Generally the פָּלִיט is someone who has completed
his escape, whereas the פָּלֵט is someone who is still on the move from
danger or has not found a settled situation. This does not mean for
either category that no danger remains. It merely identifies the
relationship between the fugitive and the danger they initially flee,
and the safety they seek. Thus in Gn 14.13, Ezk 24.26, 27, 33.21, 22 the
פָּלִיט has essentially left the area where they were initially under
threat. Of course a different threat may encounter the fugitive at this
stage (e.g. Ob 14). The פְּלִיטֵי אֶפְרַיִם in Jdg 12.5 are in mortal danger,
but have left the initial danger horizon of the battlefield. Whatever
פְּלִיטֵי אֶפְרַיִם means in Jdg 12.4, it is clear that those denoted have left
Ephraim as a horizon in the past. Likewise the פְּלִיטֵי הַגּוֹיִם(Is 45.20),
and פְּלִיטֵיכֶם (Ezk 6.9) are those who have already survived the danger. In
statements that there was/should be/will be no one who escaped/escapes,
פָּלִיט is used (Josh 8.22, 2Kg 9.15, Jr 42.17, 44.14, Am 9.1, La 2.22),
because this term best refers to successful escape (cf. Ezk 7.16). The
difference in distribution between the two terms may also be illustrated
by the distinction between פְּלִיטֵי חֶרֶב(Jr 44.28, Ezk 6.8) for whom the
process of flight is complete (the danger horizon of the חֶרֶב is in the
past), and theפְּלֵטִים מֵחֶרֶב (Jr 51.50) who are addressed as still on the
run, and are encouraged not to stop. Likewise, the פְּלֵטִים, parallel with
נָסִים , in Jr 50.28 are still on the run.

Because a פָּלֵט is often someone who still has to journey to complete
their escape, the term can take on a negative connotation (e.g. Nu
21.29). On the other hand, for the phrases negating the existence of a
פָּלִיט to have a negative connotation (e.g. Josh 8.22), a פָּלִיט must be
able to be an essentially positive thing. This also relieves the tension
felt in Jr 44.14 where the existence of a פָּלִיט is denied, but the
presence of פְּלֵטִים is permitted. If the latter has negative connotations
and the former positive ones then both statements are to be understood
as negative in tone. The existence of פְּלִיטֵי חֶרֶבin Jr 44.28 need not
contradict 44.14, since פְּלִיטֵי חֶרֶבare merely those who have escaped the
sword, and are not designated “escaped ones” in an unqualified sense.

Some support for this general distinction in meanings is given by
morphology. If the explanation of Waltke & O’Connor is preferred to that
of Barth (see Formal Characteristics A.1), and פָּלִיט is a passive
participle and פָּלֵט an active one, it would be natural for the former to
take on a past time frame reference.

The distinction between the lexemes need not be absolute. Thus in Am 9.1
נָס appears in parallel to פָּלִיט suggesting that the פָּלִיט was still on the
move.

**A.3**  Parallel with שָׂרִיד (Josh 8.22, Jr 42.17, 44.14, Ob 14, La 2.22), נָס
(Am 9.1).

**B.1**  [nil]

## 6. Exegesis

**A.1**  The exegesis of a number of individual passages is covered in
Lexical/Semantic Field(s).

**A.2**  Hasel (1974:184) believes that in Am 9.1 the terms אַחֲרִית and פָּלִיט
“throw light upon each other”. However, the relationship between נָס and
פָּלִיט is closer.

**A.3**  Zorell (651a) understands פָּלִיט as “qui salvus seu superstes est”,
and Alonso Schökel (584b) understands it as “superviviente, evadido,
escapado, fugado, fugitivo”.

**A.4**  The notion of survived danger is not at all obvious for Jdg 12.4.

**B.1**  [nil]

## 7. Conclusion

**A.1**  The פָּלִיט is generally a person who has escaped a horizon of danger.
It is often to be contrasted with פָּלֵט, which depicts someone as still on
the move, or unsettled. פָּלִיט does not have the negative connotations
usually present in פָּלֵט.

**B.1**  Zorell (651a) advocates the complementary nature of פָּלִיט and פָּלֵט,
the latter seeming to supply the absolute pl of פָּלִיט. It has been argued
in Lexical/Semantic Field(s) that this conclusion cannot be sustained.
