## <span id="RCM">1. Root and Comparative Material</span>



<b>A.1</b> 
The etymology of the noun <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶד</span> is uncertain (<i>CEDHL</i>, 681). For an overview of previous proposals, see Ges<sup>18</sup>, 1299. Since the interchange between <i>d</i> and <i>ṭ</i> occurs more often (cf. GHAL, Part 1, 27; <i>SLOCG</i>, § 12.2), a connection with √<span dir="rtl">שׂרט</span>, ‘to make incisions’, <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶט</span>, ‘incision’, and its cognates (Ges<sup>18</sup>, 1299-300) might be considered. 



<b>A.2</b>
<i>Akkadian.</i>
A connection with <i>sirdû</i>, ‘pole of a chariot’ (<i>CAD</i> (S), 312) [<i>not</i>: ‘awl’ which is <i>marṣāʾu</i> in Assyrian → <span dir="rtl">מַרְצֵעַ</span>], is unlikely both because of its meaning and the contracted end-vowel.
However, Old Assyrian <i>sarādum</i>, ‘to harness, load’, and <i>masradum</i>, ‘pack-saddle’ (Veenhof 1972: 9-11), might be related if perforated leather straps were used.



<b>A.3</b> 
<i>Ugaritic.</i>
A connection with <i>srdnn</i>, according to <i>DULAT</i><sup>3</sup>, 759, ‘a type of projectile or missile’, seems unlikely, both because of the different sibilant and because of the entirely different context.



<b>A.4</b> 
<i>Syriac.</i>
If the connection with √<i>śrṭ</i> proposed above is tenable, comparison with Syriac <span dir="rtl">ܣܪܛ</span> (<i>seraṭ</i>), ‘to scratch, make a line or stroke ... to draw or write a line’, <span dir="rtl">ܣܪܛܐ</span> (<i>serṭā</i>), ‘scratch, gash, line, character’, <span dir="rtl">ܡܣܪܛܐ</span> (<i>masrāṭā</i>), ‘scalpel’ (Payne Smith, <i>CSD</i>, 286, 391; Brockelmann, <i>LS</i>, 498-99), is certainly enlightening.
 


<b>A.4</b> 
<i>Classical Arabic.</i>
Several authors have proposed a connection with <i>sarada</i> in the meaning of ‘to perforate’ (Lane, 1346-47), <i>sarīd</i>, <i>sirrād</i>, ‘awl’ (<i>DAF</i>, 1080). The correspondence between Heb. <i>ś</i> and Arab. <i>s</i> is problematic, but not decisive (cf. <i>HAWAT</i>, 470-71; Thomas 1971: 325; <i>SLOCG</i>, 123-25). See also <a href="#Con">Conclusions</a>.
 


<b>A.4</b> 
<i>Modern Arabic.</i>
Syro-Palestinian Arabic <i>masrad</i>, ‘awl’ (<i>DPASyr</i>, 243).
 


<b>A.5</b> 
<i>Greek.</i>
In <i>SFG</i>, 57-58, the possibility is considered that σάρδιον, ‘the Sardian stone’ or ‘sard’, also attested in Rev 4:3, would be a Semitic loanword. König,  <i>HAWAT</i>, 471, calls this difficult, without giving reasons. Lewy misunderstood the quotation from Pliny he gave. The sard was used as a stone for seals because it was relatively soft and therefore easy to engrave (Bolman 1938: 93-95). For this reason it is unlikely that it was used in a tool for engraving gems or in shaping a wooden image.

Isa 44:13.



<b>A.1</b> 
The Greek Version of Isaiah 44:13 raises a text-critical problem. It does not run in accordance with MT. In fact, <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">mt</span> and <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> present a different picture of the making of cult objects or idols. In its description of the activities of the carpenter <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">mt</span> contains four technical terms (→ <span dir="rtl">קַו</span> and <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶד</span>, → <span dir="rtl">מַּקְצֻעָה</span> and → <span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span>) in four cola. The <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> does not provide an exact correspondence of this. The main manuscripts inexplicably connect ἐκλεξάμενος, ‘having chosen’, with v. 12. Moreover, <span dir="rtl">נָטָה קָו</span> is rendered inaccurately by ἔστησεν αὐτὸ ἐν μέτρῳ, ‘he sets it up with a measure’. The next two cola are skipped and <span dir="rtl">וּבַמְּחוּגָה יְתָאֳרֵהוּ</span> is translated καὶ ἐν κόλλῃ ἐρρύθμισεν, ‘and he composed it with glue’. Possibly ἐν κόλλῃ  is an early error for ἐν κυκλῳ, ‘with a circle’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span>).
It seems therefore that the <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> does not help much in establishing the meaning of <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶד</span>. However, in v. 12 καὶ ἐν τερέτρῳ ἔτρησεν αὐτό, ‘and he bored it with an awl’, is <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span>’s strange rendering of <span dir="rtl">וּבַמַּקָּבֹות יִצְּרֵהוּ</span>, ‘and with hammers he shapes it’. Because the translators of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> knew the correct rendering of <span dir="rtl">מַקֶּבֶת</span> well (<i>HIS</i>, 87), it is possible that originally ‘and he bored it with an awl’ was the rendering of <span dir="rtl">יְתָאֲרֵ֣הוּ בַשֶּׂ֔רֶד</span>, but that somehow the difficult text of vv. 12-13 got into disorder.


<b>A.2</b> 
αʹ renders καὶ ἐμόρφωσεν αὐτὸ ἐν παραγραφίδι, ‘he shapes it with a writing instrument’ (cf. <i>LSJ</i>, 1306). In the Syro-Hexapla this is interpreted as <span dir="rtl">ܒܓܘ̈ܢܬܐ</span>, ‘with a ruler’.
In some manuscripts of αʹ  these words are found for the words translated by <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> as ἔστησεν αὐτὸ ἐν μέτρῳ . Other manuscripts of αʹ  add καὶ ἐμόρφωσεν αὐτὸ ἐν παραγραφίδι  to <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span>’s ἔστησεν αὐτὸ ἐν μέτρῳ . 



<b>A.3</b> 
Pesh has <span dir="rtl">ܘܒܬܬܐ ܕܒܩܗ ܘܓܠܦܗ</span>, ‘he fastens it with glue, and engraves it’, of which <span dir="rtl">ܘܓܠܦܗ</span> looks like the remnant of an earlier rendering.
Perhaps this is to be connected to the Syro-Lucianic version of Isaiah, which contains a rendering of the two cola's missing in <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> and <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">s</span>, the whole verse reads as follows: <span dir="rtl">ܘܐܩܝܡܗ ܒܡܫܘܚܬܐ ܘܒܕܝܒܝܛܐ ܪܫܡܗ ܘܒܦܪܙܠܐ ܓܠܦܗ ܘܒܬܬܐ ܕܒܩܗ</span> (Ceriani 1868-71: 18) ‘and sets it up with a measure, marks it with a carpenter’s square, engraves it with an iron and fastens it with glue’. 
It shares the same wording in the two cola's which are present in Pesh.
The disorder mentioned in the discussion of the Greek version may be visible even in Pesh: when placed alongside <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">mt</span>, it seems that Pesh has the second and the third part inverted. When <span dir="rtl">ܘܓܠܦܗ</span> is rendering <span dir="rtl">יְתָאֲרֵהוּ</span>, it may be supposed that even Pesh* had this inversion.



<b>A.4</b>
Tg apparently guessed, based on the parallelism in the Hebrew text, with <span dir="rtl">קַו</span>.



## <span id="LSF">5. Lexical/Semantic Fields</span>


<b>A.1</b> 
The word is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> and is one of the four utensils mentioned which a carpenter used to shape a wooden image of a god (→ <span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span>; → <span dir="rtl">מַּקְצֻעָה</span>; <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span>; → <span dir="rtl">קַו</span>). With the exception of <span dir="rtl">קַו</span>, ‘measuring line’, the precise meaning of these technical terms is difficult to establish.



## <span id="Exe">6. Exegesis</span>

### <span id="Exe-lit">6.1 Textual Evidence</span>


<b>A.1</b>
The word <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> is explained in several degrees of certainty, for the following paragraph only primary choices are quoted. Some connect <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> to the direct context of Isa 44:13 without giving any further specification of the instument given: ‘ein Werkzeug des “Meisters i. Holz”’ (Ges<sup>18</sup>, 1299), or ‘Werkzeug des Bildschnitzers’ (<i>HWAT</i>, 762). Some are reluctant but are presenting a possible meaning: ‘Die richtige Bedeutung des Wortes bleibt offen’ (Gradwohl 1963, 85-86), <i>HAL</i>, 1262: ‘die Bedtg. des sbst. ist ungewiss’ ... ‘Ahle, Pfriem ... Reisstift ... wohl vorzuziehen’.
Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 1337-38 has ‘stilus’, and is supported by <i>BDB</i>, 975: ‘from context, a marking-tool’ and <i>HAWAT</i>, 470-71; but also by: <i>HCHAT</i>, Bd. 2, 498: ‘Griffel, Stift, zum Zeichnen’); Zorell, 807: ‘instrumentum artificis ad opificium praedesignandum: frt. graphis, stilus’, <i>DBHE</i>, 714: ‘lápiz, estilo, punzón’, <i>CEDHL</i>, 681: ‘stylus, marking tool ... usually translated from the context’, Avitzur, 162: <span dir="rtl">מין מרצע</span> (‘a kind of awl’).
‘A carpenter's tool having a sharp point’, (viz. the Hebrew-Arabic dictionary by David ben Abraham mentioned in Blau 1995: 691; MHH, 1143: <span dir="rtl">חרט לעיבור עץ בעשיית הפסילים</span> (‘graving-tool to carve wood for making idols’). Delitzsch 1889 has ‘Reiß- oder Zeichenstift’, Elliger 1978 has as primary choice ‘Reißstift’). <i>EncB</i> vol. 3, 3646 seems to follow the same explanation but also presents the rendering of Haupt ‘“<span dir="rtl">שׄרד</span> compasses,”’ which Haupt connects with the Assyrian <i>sirdû</i>, ‘yoke’.
Some explicitly refer to the Rabbinical rendering, which is to be discarded (cf. discussion below par. B.2) <i>GB</i>, 792: ‘wahrsch.: Stift, n. Kimchi: Rötel, Rotstift’, <i>KBL</i>, 930: ‘nach d. Zusammenhang Rötel, according to context red chalk (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)’.



<b>A.2</b>
The various suggestions as how to render <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> are emulating from the textual context. In Isa 44:13, the shaping of a wooden image of a god is presented in several stages connected to the four utensils. The last two utensils (<span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> and <span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span>) are gouverned by the imperfect <span dir="rtl">יְְתָאֲרֵהוּ</span>, ‘he traces it, outlines it’, this would suggest that the enumeration does not intend to describe successive stages in the carpenter’s work and that both tools were used in drawing lines. The instruments are used to mold the wood so that the end-result would be <span dir="rtl">כְּתַבְנִית אִ֔ישׁ כְּתִפְאֶרֶת אָדָם</span>, ‘in human form, with human beauty’, to be placed in a house or shrine (<span dir="rtl">בָּֽיִת</span>).



<b>B.1</b>
Alternative choices are found in: <i>EncB</i> vol. 3, 3646; Ellinger 1978; <i>EncM</i>, vol 8, 388-89; Gradwohl 1963; Ges<sup>18</sup>, 1299; <i>HAL</i>, 1262; <i>HCHAT</i>, Bd. 2, 498; <i>HWAT</i>, 762; Genesius, <i>TPC</i> 1337-38.



<b>B.2</b>
In the Middle Ages rabbinical interpretations of <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> crop up which explain the word as a red-dyed cord. As Blau 1995: 695 has demonstrated convincingly, this interpretation goes back to an erroneous understanding of the Arabic translation of Saadya Gaon by the famous Hebrew lexicographer Ibn Janaḥ who was reponsible for the theory that <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> would be a red-dyed cord or red marking tool. This theory was perpetuated up to modern times, but should definitely be discarded.
As noted by Blau 1995: 691, the correct interpretation is found in the Hebrew-Arabic dictionary of David ben Abraham: ‘a carpenter's tool having a sharp point’.



### <span id="Exe-fig">6.2 Figurative Use</span>


<b>A.1</b>
Not attested.





### <span id="Exe-ico">6.3 Pictorial Material</span>


<b>A.1</b>
Whether or not one of the depicted carpenters in the tomb of Rekh-mi-Rē is using an awl is not sure, but one of the carpenters is depicted completing a statue (Davies 1943, Plate <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lv</span>), which is a situation comparable to Isa 44:13. 



### <span id="Exe-ar">6.4 Archaeology</span>


<b>A.1</b>
One might refer to a Egyptian collection of bronze woodworking tools part of a carpenter’s kit (for an example of a kit with tools, see Figure 1). See Figure 2 for an example of bronze awls as found in many excavations in Egypt and the Levant (<i>AEMT</i>, 356).

## <span id="Con">7. Conclusion</span>





<b>A.1</b>
In Isa 44:13, both the embracing parallelism between <span dir="rtl">קַו</span> and <span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span>, and the vertical verse-line parallelism between <span dir="rtl">יְתָאֲרֵ֣הוּ</span>, ‘he traces it, outlines it’, in vv. 13aB and 13bB suggest that <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> and <span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span> were measuring tools. The etymological cognates, especially the Syriac and Arabic ones, suggest a sharp-pointed tool used to incise a line in the wood, what we would call a ‘scriber’, or ‘scratch awl’. This is supported by Aquila’s rendering and by the medieval Hebrew-Arabic lexicographer David ben Abraham. Joshua Blau has demonstrated that other Jewish renderings from the Middle Ages, though repeated up till modern times, rested on an erroneous interpretation of the Arabic translation of Saadya Gaon. It is possible that the original rendering of the Old Greek was ‘awl’ but that the text got into disorder as a result of which the phrase landed in v. 12. Also <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">s</span> seems to reflect an earlier translation which involved an engraving tool.


<b>A.2</b>
The description of a Palestinian carpenter’s work in Avitzur, 166, renders it likely that <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> was more or less a synonym of → <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>. Thin-blade awls have been found in ancient Egypt (<i>AEMT</i>, 356).

<b>A.3</b>
The broader context of the polemic in Isa 44:9-20 does not aim at providing the student with either an exact knowledge of the making of cult objects or a complete survey of the tools of the craftsmen. Its distinctive purpose is the denunciation of idolatry and the proclamation that <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yhwh</span>’s power is indisputable against the vain boasting of the Mesopotamian deities and their physical representations. The description wants to bring home the message that making an idol is an utterly human, very clumsy process. It is not impossible that in choosing the term <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶר</span> the author wanted to make a contrasting pun on → <span dir="rtl">זֶרֶת</span>, ‘span’, the term he used in his magisterial description of God’s creation of the heavens (Isa 40:12).
