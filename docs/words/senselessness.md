## Introduction

Grammatical type: n.f.   
Occurrences: 3x HB (0/1/2); 0x Sir; 0x Qum.; 0x inscr. (Total: 3)

* Nebiim: Jer 23:13.
* Ketubim: Job 1:22; 24:12.


<b>A.1</b>  There are no occurrences outside the biblical text. All the
attestations of <span dir="rtl">תפלה</span> in the Qumran texts relate to  <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span>, ‘prayer’.

### Text Doubtful:

<b>B.1</b>  In Job 24:12 the Pesh presupposes a <i>Vorlage</i> <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span> (so also two Hebrew MSS: cf. BHS; Pope 1973:178). 
For many scholars[^1] this is the correct reading: ‘God does not hear their prayer’. <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span> is, however, clearly a <i>lectio facilior</i>: <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span>,
which is plausible in its context (Marböck 1995:730), is furthermore confirmed by Theodotion (ἀφροσύνη), Symmachus (μωρία) and, indirectly, by
Tg <span dir="rtl">חובא</span> (which excludes <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span>; see below <a href="#AVfTA3">4. Ancient Versions, f. Targum A.3</a>).


<b>B.2</b>  For the occurrence in Job 1:22 various emendations have been proposed, among which  <span dir="rtl">עולה</span>, ‘injustice, unrighteousness, wrong’, <span dir="rtl">נבלה</span>, ‘folly’ (see Pope 1973:178; Driver and Gray 1921:11), or, with a
different vocalisation, <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span>, in the meaning not attested elsewhere
of ‘protest’ (cf. Driver and Gray 1921:10). The reading <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> is nevertheless entirely acceptable (see below <a href="#ExA5">6. Exegesis A.5</a>).


<b>B.3</b>  In Ps 109:4 the reading <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> has been proposed in place of the <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span> of MT (see <i>HAL</i>, 1635a; Propp 1990:405). This reading, however, does not make the understanding of the text any easier.

## 1. Root and Comparative Material


<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> is connected with a root <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> I which is also represented in the HB by the adjective <span dir="rtl">תָּפֵל</span>, ‘tasteless, unseasoned’ (Job 6.6; Lam 2:14). <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> in Ezek 13:10, 11, 14, 15; 22:28 is considered by dictionaries and commentaries as a variant of <span dir="rtl">טפל</span> ‘to smear, plaster’;[^3] Propp (1990) holds, on the other hand, that it should be connected with <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> I (there would then be a single root: see also Marböck 1995:728). Considering that <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> is also associated with false prophecy in Jer 23:13 and Lam 2:14, Propp concludes that ‘Ezekiel uses <span dir="rtl">תָּפֵל</span> in the
sense ‘vanity, folly’ and puns with <span dir="rtl">טפל</span> ‘to plaster’’(1990:408). ‘If the root <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> was commonly applied to false prophecy in the sixth century, or if Ezekiel was familiar with Jeremiah 23, he might have realized that the assonance of <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> and <span dir="rtl">טפל</span> could be exploited in paranomastic
metaphor’ (Propp 1990:407). The cultural association between plaster and mortar on the one hand and hypocrisy on the other, attested by various biblical
passages (see Ps 119:69; Job 13:4; 14:17) would have favoured the emergence of this rhetorical figure in Ezekiel.  
As for the form <span dir="rtl">תִּתַּפָּל</span> in 2 Sam 22.27, it should be considered as
an abbreviation or a textual corruption for <span dir="rtl">תִּתְפַּתָּל</span> from the verb
<span dir="rtl">פתל</span> which is found in the parallel text of Ps 18.27 (Marböck 1995:728).  
In the Qumran texts there are five attestations of the root <span dir="rtl">תפל</span>: 1QH 6.36  (<span dir="rtl">לתפל</span>) is situated in a corrupt context, CD 8.12 and 19.25 refer
to Ezek 13; the two occurrences in 5Q14.1, 3 relate to a verb <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> and
the adjective )<span dir="rtl">תפלו בכול תפל</span>: a sort of linguistic play, Marböck 1995:732).

<b>A.2</b>  In Mishnaic Hebrew there are attested the adjective <span dir="rtl">תָּפֵל</span>,
‘insipid, unsalted’(referring to food: see b.Shabb 128a/b; b.Ḥul 113a)
and the substantives <span dir="rtl">תפלה</span> and <span dir="rtl">תפלות</span>: the latter is the only form
present in the Mishna and seems to replace <span dir="rtl">תפלה</span> in Mishnaic Hebrew
(Bendavid 1967-71: II,442).

<b>A.3</b>  In Tg the form  <span dir="rtl">אִיתַּפַּל</span> is attested (Tg<sup><small>O</small></sup> on Deut
1:1; BDB:1074a).

<b>A.4</b>  The Hebrew root <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> is connected by many with the Arab. <i>tafala</i>
‘to spit’and <i>tufl</i> ’saliva, spittle’.

<b>A.5</b>  Driver (Driver and Gray 1921:11) holds that the various meanings found in Arabic would have developed out of the fundamental meaning of the Semitic root ‘to be savourless’, in the following sequence: 1) to (lose
a good scent by the) neglect (of) perfume, 2) to be unperfumed, 3) to be ill-smelling, 4) to spit out (rejecting what is ill-savoured), 5) to spit (whence further meanings developed).   
Other scholars (see Tur-Sinai 1967:20ff., Ben Yehuda XVI,7853, n.2)
hold instead that the original meaning is the one attested by Arab. <i>tafala</i> ‘spit’. Propp justifies this hypothesis with the onomatopoeic assonance: ‘PS [Proto-Semitic] *<i>tpl</i> thus exemplified the widespread tendency of words with this meaning to contain a <i>p</i> and a <i>t</i>,
presumably in imitation of the act itself. English ‘spit’ and ‘ptooey’ (the sound of expectoration) are obvious examples; we also have Greek πτύω and Latin <i>spuo/sputo</i>. Aramaic has <span dir="rtl’>תְפַף/תְפֵי</span>, and
Ethiopic uses <i>tafʾa</i>. In Biblical Hebrew we find the <i>hapax legomenon</i> <span dir="rtl">תֹּפֶת</span> ‘saliva’(Job 17:6)’. In Mishnaic Hebrew the expression 
<span dir="rtl">רוק תפל</span> could maintain the memory of such an association.

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  The substantive is formed according to the pattern <i>qitl</i>.

<b>A.2</b>  It can be considered as a <i>nomen unitatis</i> related to the collective <span dir="rtl">תָּפֵל</span> (Marböck 1995:730).

<b>A.3</b>  It is always attested in the fem.sg.


<b>A.4</b>  In Mishnaic Hebrew the alternation of the pattern with <span dir="rtl">תפלות</span> is
recorded (Bendavid 1967-71, 2:442).


## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b>  There are no constructions with the particles.

<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> can refer to persons (Jer 23:13), situations (Job 24:12) and,
even though negatively, to God in Job 1:22.

<b>A.3</b>  The substantive always appears as object, with the verbs: 

* <span dir="rtl">ראה</span> in Jer 23:13; 
* <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> in Job 1:22; 
* <span dir="rtl">שׂום</span> in Job 24:12.

<b>A.4</b>  In Job 1:22 the idiomatic phrase <span dir="rtl">ְנָתַן תִּפְלָה ל</span> is recorded (see below <a href="#ExB1">6. Exegesis B.1</a>).

<b>A.5</b>  In Jer 23:13 <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> is in parallelism with <span dir="rtl">שַׁעֲרוּרָה</span> ‘abomination’ in v. 14: it is not, however, a matter of similar qualities, which are different in degree (McKane 1986:574). In Job 1:22 <span dir="rtl">ְנָתַן תִּפְלָה ל</span> is in parallel with <span dir="rtl">חָטָא</span>. There are no other contextual relations.


## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>:

* ἀνόμημα, ‘evil, transgression of the law’: Jer 23:13;
* ἀφροσύνη, ‘folly, thoughtlessness’: Job 1:22;
* Unclear: Job 24:12.


<b>A.1</b>  ἀνόμημα also translates <span dir="rtl">בליעל</span>, <span dir="rtl">ִזמָּה</span>, <span dir="rtl">חטאת</span>, <span dir="rtl">נבלה</span>, <span dir="rtl">עון</span>,  <span dir="rtl">פֶּשַׁע</span> and <span dir="rtl">תועבה</span>.

<b>A.2</b>  ἀφροσύνη also translates <span dir="rtl">אולת</span>, <span dir="rtl">כסיל</span>, <span dir="rtl">כֶּסֶל</span>, <span dir="rtl">כִסְלָה</span>, <span dir="rtl">נבלה</span>, <span dir="rtl">סָכָל</span>, <span dir="rtl">סכלות</span>, <span dir="rtl">פְּתִי</span> and <span dir="rtl">תָּפֵל</span>.

<b>A.3</b>  In Job 24:12 the expression ἐπισκοπὴν ποιεῖν ’pay attention, be watchful’ is used. It is probably a case of an interpretative rendering of the context.

<b>A.4</b>  The LXX offers a different rendering for each occurrence. One could say that, beginning from an intuition of the real meaning of the lexeme offered in Job 1:22 (note that ἀφροσύνη is also found in Symmachus and
Theodotion), it prefers in the other two cases to have recourse to an interpretation of the meaning from the context (see also below <a href="#ExA1">6. Exegesis A.1</a>).

<b>B.1</b>  HRCS<sup><small>1</small></sup>, 285c mistakenly mentions the translation of
<span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> by δέησις: it is in fact a case of <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span>. The error has been corrected in HRCS<sup><small>2</small></sup>, 285c.


<b>b.  Aquila (αʹ)</b>:

* ἄναλος, ‘without salt, unsalted’: Jer 23:13’

<b>A.1</b>  The rendering of αʹ reflects the intention of the translation to keep close to the original language, adapting itself in this case to the primary meaning attested by the adjective (see McKane 1986:573; Marböck 1995:730): see below <a href="#ExA1">6. Exegesis A.1</a>.


<b>c. Symmachus (σʹ)</b>:

* ἀφροσύνη, ‘folly, thoughtlessness’:Jer 23:13;
* ἀφρονεύομαι, ‘to be silly, act foolishly’: Job 1:22;
* μωρία, ‘folly’: Job 24:12.

<b>A.1</b>  In Job 1:22 the phrase
<span dir="rtl">וְלֹא־נָתַן תִּפְלָה לֵאלֹהִים</span> would seem to have been partly ‘censored’: in fact οὐδὲ ἠφρονεύσατο certainly presupposes <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span>
(see ἀφροσύνη in Jer 23:13), but the fact that Job could (even if negatively) have attributed this quality to God is passed over in silence (see below <a href="#ExA5">6. Exegesis A.5</a>). A similar tendency can also be
observed in the Targum, the Peshitta and the Vulgate in the same verse.

<b>A.2</b>  For all the three occurrences Symmachus remains consistent in his rendering of the meaning of the lexeme.


<b>d. Theodotion (θʹ)</b>:

* ἀφροσύνη, ‘folly, thoughtlessness’: Job 24:12.

<b>A.1</b>  The translation of θʹ for this occurrence is important, because it confirms the Hebrew <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> against the reading <span dir="rtl">תְּפִלָּה</span> preferred by some commentators on the basis of Pesh.


<b>e. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <i>daggālutā’</i>, ‘deceptiveness’: Jer 23:13;
* no equivalent: Job 1:22;
* different text: Job 24:12.

<b>A.1</b>  In Job 1:22 the expression dir="rtl">ְנָתַן תִּפְלָה ל</span> is translated by the verb <i>gaddep</i> ‘blaspheme’. It is an example of the same tradition of interpretation as in Tg and Vg.

<b>A.2</b>  In Job 24.14 we have ‘their prayer’, which presupposes a <i>Vorlage</i> dir="rtl">ְתְּפִלָה</span>.


<b>f. Targum (Tg: J/K/11QTgJob)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">רְשׁעַ</span>, ‘wickedness, evil’: Jer 23:13<sup><small>J</small></sup>;
* <span dir="rtl">מלי מטחא</span>, ‘rebellious words’: Job 1:22<sup><small>K</small></sup>;
* no equivalent: Job 24:12<sup><small>K,11QTgJob</small></sup>.

<b>A.1</b>  The rendering of Tg Jer 23:13 corresponds to that of the LXX and is of a metaphorical kind: this meaning could already have developed in Hebrew from the denotation ‘lack of salt’ (McKane 1986:573).

<b>A.2</b>  Job 1:22 seems to share the same censorious mentality which inspired the translation of Symmachus (see above): <span dir="rtl">וְלֹא־נָתַן תִּפְלָה לֵאלֹהִים</span> becomes: 
<span dir="rtl">בכל דא לא חב איוב ולא סדר מלי מטחא קדם ייי</span>, ‘In all this Job did not sin, nor did he utter rebellious words before the Lord’. In b.BB 12a Raba comments: ‘With his lips he did not sin, but he did sin with his heart’ (Mangan 1991:27 note), grasping the nature of the defensive cover-up in the statement.

<span id="AVfTA3"><b>A.3</b></span>
  The text of Job 24:12 in 11QTgJob is partially different: ‘will God not bring its <i>punishment</i> (literally ‘debt’ <span dir="rtl">חוב</span>)’. It seems to be a case of a paraphrase of the text, which in essence considers <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> as really the non-punitive intervention of God.


<b>g. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>fatuitas</i>, ‘foolishness, folly, silliness’: Jer 23:13;
* <i>quid stultum</i>, ‘something foolish, silly’: Job 1:22;
* no equivalent: Job 24:12.


<b>A.1</b>  While <i>fatuitatem</i> in Jer 23:13 corresponds to the line of interpretation followed by Symmachus, Job 1:22 (<i>in omnibus his non peccavit Iob neque stultum quid contra Deum locutus est</i>) is parallel to Tg. As for Job 24:12 (<i>et Deus inultum abire non patitur</i>), it seems to be a case of the same paraphrase as that encountered in 11QTgJob.

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields


<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> ‘senselessness, irrationality’ forms part of the lexical
field of the substantives of ‘knowledge’ (Sciumbata 1996-97) and is situated at the negative pole of the field. On the paradigmatic level it is in polar opposition with all the lexemes of the positive pole, but its own direct polar antonym is <span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, ‘reason’, which in the theoretical-speculative dimension (a semic feature shared with other lexemes, which understands knowledge as a theoretical matter) indicates
a faculty considered from the standpoint of the effects which are produced by it: <span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, ‘reason’ is the intellectual faculty which ensures
a man’s poise and good sense. In contrast <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> ‘senselessness, irrationality’ indicates the lack of rationality and good sense in his
actions. It is characterised by the features: ‘lack of the comprehensive faculty of thought’; ‘understood from its effects as the source of lack of poise and good sense’.  
At the negative pole <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> is opposed to <span dir="rtl">פְּתַיּוּת</span>, ‘silliness, lack of knowledge’ (which contains the seme ‘information’, while <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> contains the seme ‘faculty’) and to <span dir="rtl">כְּסִילוּת</span>, ‘obtuseness’ (which indicates instead the lack of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, namely the mental faculty which is open to knowledge). It has no polar antonymy with 
<span dir="rtl">פֶּתִי</span>, ‘silliness, lack of
education’, insofar as this lexeme belongs to the jargon of the didactic
strand in the wisdom movement; the same applies for 
<span dir="rtl">הוֹלֵלוֹת/הוֹלֵלוּת</span>,
‘insipience, ignorance’, 
<span dir="rtl’>שִׂכְלוּת/סִכְלוּת</span>, ‘stupidity’, 
<span dir="rtl">סֶכֶל</span>, ‘stupidity’, 
<span dir="rtl">כֶּסֶל</span>, ‘obtuseness’, which appear as neologisms coined by Qoheleth.


<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> does not appear in all the functional languages of BHeb.: it is present in the poetic corpora of EBH1 and LBH3, as well as
in LBH1 (Job 1:22). The lexical field of the poetic language appears more articulated and richer, whether because of the greater thematic opportunity offered by the <i>corpus</i> to deploy from this lexicon or
through the actual existence of words characterised as poetic (<span dir="rtl">דֵּעָה</span>, ‘knowledge’, 
<span dir="rtl">לֶקַח</span>, ‘instruction’, 
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span>,  ‘intelligence’ and
‘judgement= sense, good sense’, 
<span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, ‘discernment’, the last only in the pre-exilic language). It is then possible that <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> is a poetic
term, whose appearance in the frame of the book of Job should be
ascribed to an intentional intertextual echo of the statements in Job 24:12 (see below <a href="#ExA5">6. Exegesis A.5</a>).


## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> derives from the adjective <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> ‘insipid’: it indicates therefore the lack of salt. This denotation can also be understood in a metaphorical sense to indicate the uselessness of a given action (see Lam 2:14, in parallelism with <span dir="rtl">שָׁוְא</span>). In line with a semantic development common to other languages (cf. e.g. Italian ‘insulso’ or Tuscan sciocco’), the lack of salt is projected onto the mental and cognitive plane, indicating the lack of rationality and sound sense.[^4] That <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> indicates essentially a lack of intellectual discrimination had already been grasped by the LXX (McKane 1986:573; Marböck 1995:730), which has ἀφροσύνη in Job 1:22.[^5] On the other hand the primary meaning ‘lack of salt’ is reflected in αʹ at Jer 23:13 (ἄναλος), while elsewhere the translations interpret the substantive in a metaphorical sense on the
moral or religious plane.[^6]  
That it is a matter of a semantic development by means of synaesthesia (Kedar-Kopfstein 1988:54) can be confirmed by the parallel process in the antonym <span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, ‘taste’ > ‘reason’: the connection between the two lexemes had already been noticed by the medieval Jewish commentators Rashi and Ibn Ezra.  
Among the dictionaries, Schökel is the only one to grasp this interpretation of the meaning: ‘insipidez, tonteria, desatino’ (<i>DBHE</i>, 804).

<b>A.2</b>  The lexeme <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> ‘senselessness, irrationality’ is probably a
poetic word. It belongs to the lexical field of knowledge. The antonym of <span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, ’reason’, it is characterised by the features: ‘negative pole’,
‘theoretical-speculative dimension’, ‘class: faculty’, ‘lack of the comprehensive faculty of thought’, ‘(understood) in its effects as the source of lack of poise and good sense’ (Sciumbata 1996-97:349): it
indicates in practice the mental deficiency of rationality and good sense, which is reflected in senseless actions (the substantive can also end up by designating these actions <i>tout court</i>).


<b>A.3</b>  In Jer 23:13
(<span dir="rtl">וּבִנְבִיאֵי שֹׁמְרוֹן רָאִיתִי תִפְלָה</span>, ‘I have seen a senselessness among the prophets of Samaria’) prophesying in the name of Baal is stigmatised by <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span>, as senseless behaviour (fruit of the lack of <span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, ‘reason’), which will lead to destruction (McKane 1986:574). It seems that the designation of the building of a non-Jewish cult by <span dir="rtl">בֵּית תִּפְלָה</span> developed from this passage, in opposition to <span dir="rtl">בֶּית תְפִל־ָה</span>  to indicate the synagogue, which is found in the rabbinic literature (Even Shoshan 1993, 4:1470).


<b>A.4</b>  In Job 24:12 
(<span dir="rtl">מֵעִיר מְתִים יִנְאָקוּ וְנֶפֶשׁ־חֲלָלִים תְּשַׁוֵּעַ וֶאֱלוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׂים תִּפְלָה</span>, ‘The dying groan from the city; the soul of the wounded begs for help and God does not regard it as senselessness/does not pay attention to such senselessness’) Job indirectly attributes senselessness to God, from the moment when he does not react to the senselessness of that which is happening: the outrageous actions of the wicked on the one hand and the sufferings of the one who has no rights and finds himself in their grip on the other (Sciumbata 1996-97:280; 2000:29).

<span id="ExA5"><b>A.5</b></span>
  The occurrence of <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> in Job 1:22 
(<span dir="rtl">בְּכָל־זֹאת לֹא־חָטָא אִיּוֹב וְלֹא־נָתַן תִּפְלָה לֵאלֹהִים</span>, ‘In all this Job did not sin and did not attribute senselessness to God’) is the only one in the narrative register (language of prose). One has the impression that the frame means to refer expressly to Job 24:12 (there is also a syntactic echo between the
two phrases
<span dir="rtl">וֶאֱלוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׂים תִּפְלָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">וְלֹא־נָתַן תִּפְלָה לֵאלֹהִים</span>), seeking to
conceal the impiety of the accusation which Job there levels at God (the tendency is carried further forward by some translations: σʹ, Tg, Pesh, Vg). This term ends by summing up the problem around which the poem revolves: because it is precisely the lack of sound sense and the irrationality of God, with regard to the canons of retributive justice taught by the traditonalist currents of the wisdom movement, which troubles Job (Sciumbata 2000:30; Nicholson 1995). The
internal cross-reference between Job 1:22 and 24:12 is recognised by
Habel (1985:360), for whom nevertheless the meaning of <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> is
‘wrong’ (see below <a href="#ExB3">B.3</a>), and the second occurrence represents a ‘typical, ironic twist’ of the poet with regard to that which is stated in Job 1:22.


<span id="ExB1"><b>B.1</b></span>
  Other scholars do not consider the possibility of a semantic development of <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> on the mental and cognitive plane and allow only a metaphorical use on the moral level. Consider, e.g., 
Propp (1990:405):
‘these abstractions (insipidity, vanity, blame) derive from a more concrete meaning of the root *<i>tpl</i> in Protosemitic’; or Driver
(Driver and Gray 1921:11), who on Job 1:22 comments: ‘to ascribe <span dir="rtl">תפלה</span> to
Yahweh should imply regarding him as having lost the moral savour or quality which had been characteristic of him (…) similarly in Jer., Yahweh sees in the prophets  <span dir="rtl">תפלה</span>, or moral deterioration’. In regard to the Greek ἀφροσύνη in Jer 23:13 and Lam 2:14 it is for him a case of ‘a tolerable attempt to reproduce the transferred moral sense of the word’. Many of the translations offered by the commentaries and the dictionaries lie on this line of interpretation.[^7] 

<b>B.2</b>  In Job 1:22 <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> is interpreted as ‘indignity, insult’ (Dahood) or ‘spittle, reproach’ (Tur-Sinai), on the basis of the connection with the Arab. <i>tafala</i> ‘to spit’ and <i>tifl</i> ‘spittle’ (Michel 1987: ad loc.; cf. Pope 1973:17; Marböck 1995:730). The expression <span dir="rtl">נָתַן תִּפְלָה לְ</span> is hence considered as the opposite of <span dir="rtl">נתן כָּבוֹד לְ</span> (so expressly Pope 1973:17). The existence of various idiomatic expressions constructed on the model <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> + substantive + <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> + <span dir="rtl">יהוה/אֱלֹהִים</span> (see 
<span dir="rtl">נָתַן כָּבוֹד לְ</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">נָתַן תּוֹדָה לְ</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">נָתַן עֹז לְ</span>) 
does not, however, justify the presumed strict 
interrelation between <span dir="rtl">נָתַן תִּפְלָה לְ</span> and <span dir="rtl">נָתַן כָּבוֹד לְ</span>: as Driver notes
(Driver and Gray 1921: II:10), the meaning of these phrases is ‘to give, i.e. ascribe, glory (praise, strength) to Yahweh, i.e. to acknowledge that Yahweh is glorious, praiseworthy or strong’ (in 1 Sam 18:8 a similar expression refers to Saul). The phrase in question
asserts that Job does not discredit God by asserting that he has displayed this quality’ (ibid.), which makes him incline towards an interpretation of <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> as a negative quality or faculty, rather than as ‘insult’ or something similar.


<span id="ExB3"><b>B.3</b></span>
  The interpretations of <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> as ‘something unworthy’ or ‘wrong’ in Job 24:12 (Gordis 1978: ad loc.; Habel 1985: ad loc.) appear to be
attempts at interpretation from the context, which do not take account of the meaning of <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> in its other two attestations, nor of the data from the ancient translations nor of those of the semantic development (see also Zorell ‘iniusta crudelitatis’ for Job 1:22 and 24:12).

## 7. Conclusions


<b>A.1</b>  According to the paradigmatic-componential analysis carried out by Sciumbata 1996-97 the lexeme <span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span> ‘senselessness, irrationality’, a
semantic development from the adjective <span dir="rtl">תפל</span> ‘insipid, lacking salt’, is probably a poetic word (it appears in the <i>standard</i> poetic language, in the poetic language of Job and in the prose frame of the book, where it seems to be an intertextual echo of Job 24:12). It belongs to the negative pole of the lexical field of the substantives for ‘knowledge’.
As the polar antonym of <span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, ‘reason’ it indicates the lack of rationality and sound sense which issues in actions and behaviour that can also be described in such a way.
