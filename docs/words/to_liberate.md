### Text doubtful:

<b>A.1</b>  4Q158 7-8:14 [... <span dir="rtl">ם</span>]<span dir="rtl">דה לע</span>[<span dir="rtl">והפ</span>] is a passage from the Reworked Pentateuch based on Exod 21:8. There are large sections of text missing but the context seems to suggest that the reading <span dir="rtl">[והפ]דה</span> is correct.

<b>A.2</b> 4Q368 2:12 <span dir="rtl">ד֯ה֯</span>[<span dir="rtl">תפ</span>… from Apocryphon Pentateuch A seems very likely, as the broken context is clearly based on Exodus 34 (cf. v. 20).

<span id="TDA3"><b>A.3</b></span>  4Q511 36:3 <span dir="rtl">לפדויים</span> could be either the noun <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> or the pass.part. of the verb. Since the text is not a legal text, the latter seems more likely.

<b>B.1</b>  It is proposed in <i>BHS</i> that the <i>qal</i> form <span dir="rtl">תִפְדֶּה</span> in Num 18:15, 16, 17 should be emended to the <i>hiph.</i>  <span dir="rtl">תַפְדֶּה</span>, since the subject is the priest and the meaning should be ‘let so. redeem’ (cf. Exod 21:8 and Vg here). But MT is retained by BDB (804); and Gray (1903:231, 233) hesitantly accepts the exceptional use of the <i>qal</i>. On the interpretation of MT see below <a href="#ExA1">Exegesis A.1</a>.  

<b>B.2</b> In Num 18:16a <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיָו</span> is taken by BDB (804) as the pass.part. of the verb, but the context favours the view of, e.g., Gray (1903:231 with ref. to p. 31) that it is from the noun <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span>.

<span id="TDB3"><b>B.3</b></span>
  In Ps 49:8 <i>BHS</i> proposes (after Gunkel 1926:211; Kraus 1978:517, and followed by Craigie 1984:357) to read <i>niph.</i> <span dir="rtl">יִפָּדֶה</span> instead of the <i>qal</i> of MT, against all the Versions. But this is consequent upon the emendation of <span dir="rtl">אָח</span> at the beginning of the verse to <span dir="rtl">אַךְ</span>, which is scarcely necessary and supported by only a few mss. The sense given to the <i>niph.</i>, ‘redeem oneself’, is also unparalleled.

<b>B.4</b> It has been suggested that <span dir="rtl">פְּדָעֵהוּ</span> in Job 33:24, from the obscure hapax legomenon <span dir="rtl">פדע</span>, should be read <span dir="rtl">פְּדֵהוּ</span> (e.g. Dhorme 1967:502; BDB, 804b). This does, however, involve the assumption of a substantial and unexplained corruption in MT. An easier correction is to read <span dir="rtl">פְּרָעֵהוּ</span>, with some mss (so Driver and Gray 1921:248-49).

<b>B.5</b>  The listing in Abegg, Bowley, and Cook 2003 includes 4Q270 2 ii:8(2x) and ii:9 (from a ms of the Damascus Document) under the verb <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, but the contexts clearly indicate that the noun  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> is intended here, and this is how the forms are analysed in DJD XVIII:145-46.

Qere/Ketiv: none.


## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  In Biblical Hebrew the related nouns <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span>, ‘ransom, means of liberation’,  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span>, ‘(action or power of) redemption’, and <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span>, ‘ransom price of human life’, occur, and the first two are also found at Qumran (see the separate entries). The root also appears 15x in Biblical PNN: 
<span dir="rtl">פְּדָיָהוּ</span>, ‘YHWH has liberated’ (1 Chron 27:20); 
<span dir="rtl">פְּדָיָה</span>, ‘YHWH has liberated’ (2 Kgs 23:36; 1 Chron 3:18, 19; Neh 3:25, 8:4, 11:7);
<span dir="rtl">פְּדָהְאֵל</span>, ‘El has liberated’ (Num 34:28); 
<span dir="rtl">פָּדוֹן</span>, ‘ransom’ (Ezra 2:44; Neh
7:47), 
<span dir="rtl">פְּדָה־צוּר</span>, ‘the Rock has liberated’ (Num 1:10, 2:20, 7:54, 59, 10:23); as well as in epigraphic PNN (<i>AHI-1</i>,  469-70; <i>AHI-1</i>, 208-09).

<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is common to all the other Semitic languages except for Aramaic, although there is a possible case in the Hermopolis papyri (<i>DNWSI</i>, 902).

<b>A.3</b>  <i>Arabic</i>: the cognate of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is <i>fadā,</i> which means ‘to redeem’ by the payment of something of equivalent value, with a substantive meaning ‘ransom’.

<b>A.4</b>  <i>Ethiopic</i>: there is the verb <i>fdy</i>, ‘release (debt), repay, restore, reward’, and the noun <i>fdyt</i> ‘repayment’ (Dillmann 1865:1378-80), and in Old S.Arabian the verb <i>fdy</i>, ‘buy, redeem (debt), acquire’ (<i>SD</i>, 43: cf. Conti Rossini 1931:217b, who adds the noun <i>fdyt</i>, ‘purchase’).

<b>A.5</b> <i>Akkadian</i> has the vb. 
<i>padû</i>/<i>pedû,</i>, meaning ‘to spare/release’ (<i>AHw</i>, 2:808b). There is also the PN <i>ilī-ipdianni</i>, ‘my god has spared/freed me’, and the form <i>pi-di-šú</i> occurs in a prayer to Ishtar to ‘deliver him from the jaws of destruction’ (Lambert 1959-60:53, l.163). In Enuma Elish VII.29 <i>padû</i> refers to the release of rebellious gods from their service to other gods, following the creation of humans (cf. parallel in VI.34 <i>wašāru</i> ‘to release’).

<b>A.6</b> In <i>Ugaritic</i> the vb. <i>pdy</i> seems to bear the same legal sense of ‘to redeem’, in the legal document text RS 16.191 + 272 = <i>KTU</i> 3.4:2, 12. In
this passage, a man named <i>Iwrkl</i> ‘redeems’ seven people from the hand of the people of Beirut (<i>birtym</i>) and will hold their estate until he can be repaid. Yaron writes: ‘<i>pdy</i>, like its Hebrew equivalents <i>padah</i> and <i>ga’al</i>, does not mean “to set free”, “to manumit”, but “to redeem”, “to ransom” … It will always refer to a three-cornered situation, involving apart from the redemptor and the person redeemed, also the person from whose power (or the place whence) the redeemed is ransomed’ (Yaron 1960:84). Stamm, however, questions whether this is the only use of <i>pdy</i> in Ugaritic, because of the existence of personal names such as <i>pdy</i> (<i>pa-di-ya</i>) and <i>bn-pdy</i> (<i>bin-pí-di-ya</i>) 
(<i>DULAT</i><small><sup>1</sup></small>, 664; but there the etymology is ‘uncertain’). If these correspond to the Hebrew  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, it could mean ‘liberate’ as well as ‘redeem’. The personal name <i>pdy</i> is possibly of the <i>qatīl</i> type
‘redeemer/liberator’ or ‘redeemed/liberated’ rather than ‘he (the god) has freed/delivered’ (Stamm 1976:390).

<b>A.7</b>  In <i>Punic</i> there is the PN <i>bʿlpdʾ</i>, ‘Baal freed/redeemed him’ (Benz 1972:97, 389, under PDY/W, with further references), which seems to correspond to the theophorous names in Ancient Hebrew. This may also be true of the Philistine (hypocoristic: Phoenician?) PN borne by a king of Ekron, <i>pdy</i>, now attested not only in a transcription into Akkadian
(<i>ANET</i>, 287-88) but in two inscriptions from the site (Gitin, Dotan, and Naveh 1997; Gitin and Cogan 1999).

<b>A.7</b>   <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> <i>qal</i> act. part. occurs in Qumran as a substantive <span dir="rtl">פודך</span>, ‘your redeemer’, as a title for God when it is the object of the verb <span dir="rtl">שבח</span>, ‘to praise’(11Q5 22:15).

<b>A.8</b>   <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> <i>qal</i> pass.part. also occurs as a substantive <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִים</span>, ‘those redeemed’, and is the subject of the verbs <span dir="rtl">שׁוּב</span>, ‘to return’, and <span dir="rtl">בּוֹא</span>, ‘to come’ (Isa 35:10= 51:11). It is also in a construct relationship with <span dir="rtl">יהוה</span> (Isa 35:10= 51:11). In 4Q511 36:3 the context is largely lost, but the nature of the text makes it more likely that <span dir="rtl">לפדויים</span> is rather the <i>qal</i> pass.part. than a noun, meaning ‘ransom-price’ (see 
<a href="#TDA3">Text Doubtful, A.3</a> above).

<b>A.9</b>  The human subject of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> <i>niph.</i> is 
<span dir="rtl">כָּל־חֵרֶם אֲשֶׁר יָחֳרַם מִן־הָאָדָם</span>, ‘anyone committed to the ban’, in a cultic context (Lev 27:29); <span dir="rtl">שִׁפְחָה</span>, ‘slave-girl’, in a socio-legal context, with the only instance of a <i>hoph.</i> inf.abs. (Lev 19:20) and <span dir="rtl">צִיּוֹן</span>, ‘Zion’, in an eschatological context (Isa 1:27) with the preposition <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, ‘with’ [means] +  <span dir="rtl">מִשְׁפָט</span>, ‘justice’, and  <span dir="rtl">צְדָקָה</span>, ‘righteousness’ (Isa 1:27).
These examples imply that the meaning of the <i>niph.</i> was always passive (so BDB): Ps 49:8 (see above <a href="#TDB3">Text Doubtful, B.3</a>) would be exceptional if it were a reflexive <i>niph.</i>.

<b>A.10</b>  The human subject of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> <i>hiph.</i> is <span dir="rtl">אָדוֹן</span>, ‘master’ (Exod 21:8), and  its object is 3fem.sg. sf. ‘her’ referring to a man’s daughter sold as a slave (Exod 21:8). A similar instance is found at 4Q158 7-8:14 although a large amount of text is missing. The subject and object are assumed to be the same.

<i>Niphal</i>: 

* λυτρόω passive, ‘to be ransomed, redeemed’: Lev 19:20; 27:29;
* σῴζω passive, ‘to be saved, attain salvation’: Isa 1:27.

<i>Hiphil</i>: 

* ἀπολυτρόω, ‘to release from bondage on payment of ransom’: Exod 21:8.

<i>Hophal</i>: 

* λύτρον pl., ‘sum payable as ransom’: Lev 19:20.


<b>A.1</b>  The main difference between the active form of λυτρόω / ἀπολυτρόω and the middle voice is that the former is used of the person releasing someone, i.e. ‘to release on receipt of ransom’ (as in Exod 21:8), while
the latter describes the action of someone providing the means for another’s release, i.e. ‘to release by payment of ransom, redeem’ (LSJ, 1067a), which is the most frequently used form used by the LXX to translate  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>.

<b>A.2</b>  It is interesting to note that among the other Hebrew verbs translated by λυτρόω and ῥύομαι (‘to set free, redeem, deliver’; ‘to protect’, LSJ, 694) are those defined by Sawyer as the semantic field of <span dir="rtl">הוֹשִׁיעַ</span>, namely 
<span dir="rtl">נצל</span> (<i>hiph.</i>), 
<span dir="rtl">חלץ</span> (<i>piel</i>), 
<span dir="rtl">מלט</span> (<i>piel</i>), 
<span dir="rtl">פלט</span> (<i>piel</i>),
and <span dir="rtl">פצה</span>.

<b>A.3</b>  The use of the noun λύτρον pl. in Lev 19:20 and Num 18:15 – it is usually used in plural in 
Gk. – represents the inf.abs. in a common Septuagintal idiom (Thackeray 1908; Sollamo 1985).

<b>A.4</b>  λυτρόω is used across the whole range of literature, bearing no distinction between socio-legal, cultic or religious contexts. ῥύομαι however, is only used outside of the technical legal and cultic contexts.

<b>A.5</b>  ἀφορίζω + ἐξ in Isa 29:22 is slightly unusual; it appears to correspond to <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> + <span dir="rtl">מִן</span>, but carries the idea of appropriating something, or marking it off as one’s own, which is closer to the meaning of  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>, <span dir="rtl">פלה</span> <i>hiph.</i> or <span dir="rtl">פרד</span>. The use of ἀλλάσσω marks out cases where substitution rather than payment is involved.

<b>A.6</b>  Isa 35:10 is a parallel to Isa 51:11 and yet is rendered very differently in the LXX, in a very free translation, bearing little resemblance to the MT.

<b>A.7</b>  προσεύχομαι in 1 Sam 14:45 is not a translation of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>. It is either
a mistake on the translator’s part, or evidence of a different Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i>, presumably <span dir="rtl">ויפלל</span> (Smith 1904:125).

<b>A.1</b>  The strongest tendency among the Three is to eliminate other renderings in favour of λυτρόω.

<b>A.2</b>  Symmachus, however, has ῥύομαι in three non-technical instances where LXX has λυτρόω, thus preferring the less specialised equivalent.

<b>A.1</b>  In addition to <i>redimo</i> (its most common equivalent) the Vg uses a range of verbs to translate  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, some of which emphasise an exchange in the ransom, e.g. <i>muto</i>, <i>pretium do/accipio</i> (similar to ἀλλάσσω, ἀπολυτρόω, in LXX) and others which give a general sense of liberation and rescue from danger, e.g. <i>eruo</i> and <i>libero</i>.

<b>A.2</b>  In Lev 19:20 Vg uses a noun to render the Heb. inf.abs. (cf. above LXX A.3). In Num 18:15 <i>pretium</i> also corresponds to an inf.abs., but the
verb <i>accipio</i> is used instead of <i>redimo</i> in accordance with Vg’s recognition that in vv. 15-17 the subject of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is not the worshipper but the priest. It is perhaps in order to avoid a further unusual translation that in v. 16 Vg has no separate rendering of <span dir="rtl">תפדה</span>.


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b>  Verbs found in parallelism with 
<span dir="rtl">פדה</span> are 
<span dir="rtl">גאל</span>, ‘to rescue’ (Jer 31:11, Hos 13:14); 
<span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to deliver’ (Jer 15:21); 
<span dir="rtl">מלט</span> <i>piel</i>, ‘to deliver’ (Job 6:23, Sir 51:12); 
<span dir="rtl">יצא</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to lead out’ (Deut 7:8; 13:6); 
<span dir="rtl">עלה</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to bring up/out’ (Mic 6:4; 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 11:19); <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to save’ (11Q19 59:11).

<b>A.2</b>  A number of different verbs and phrases are associated with <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>:   
a) <span dir="rtl">נתן חפשה</span>, ‘to give freedom’ (Lev 19:20) is partially opposed to <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, reinforcing the idea that <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> involves a ransom price, as distinct from what is freely given. This is also supported by <span dir="rtl">נתן כפר</span>, ‘to give a price’, in Ps 49:8 (cf. A.4).   
b)  Other ‘salvation’ words from the semantic field occur in close proximity to <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, namely <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>, ‘to redeem’ (Lev 27:27, Ps 69:19), and <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to deliver’ (Isa 50:2; Sir 51:2; 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 10:32).   
c)  In the context of the Exodus rescue <span dir="rtl">יצא</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to lead out’ (Deut 9:26), also occurs alongside <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>.   
d)  Other verbs used in close proximity with <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> are <span dir="rtl">חנן</span>, ‘to be gracious’ (Ps 26:11); <span dir="rtl">עזר</span>, ‘to help’ (Ps 44:27; 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 10:35); <span dir="rtl">לקח</span>, ‘to take/receive’ (Ps 49:16); <span dir="rtl">קבץ</span>, ‘to gather’ (Zech 10:8); <span dir="rtl">חשׂך</span>, ‘to hold back’ (Sir 51:2); <span dir="rtl">רבה</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to multiply’ (11Q19 59:12); <span dir="rtl">יצא</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to lead out’ (11Q19 54:16); <span dir="rtl">סלח</span>, ‘to forgive/pardon’ (4Q504 4:7);  <span dir="rtl">טהר</span> <i>piel</i> (4Q511 36:3).

<b>A.3</b>  The title of God associated with <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> in 11Q5 22:15 is <span dir="rtl">עליון</span>, ‘the Most High’.


<b>A.4</b>   <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> also occurs in opposition to <span dir="rtl">זבח</span>, ‘to sacrifice’, in Exod 13:15. The first-born which are not sacrificed are redeemed, using <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> to make
the contrast of life and death. <span dir="rtl">מכר</span> is also used in opposition to 
<span dir="rtl">פדה</span> 
<i>hiph.</i> in Exod 21:8, contrasting ‘selling’ in the context of slavery with ‘redemption’ into freedom (compare the opposition of <span dir="rtl">מכר</span> and <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> in Isa 52:3).

## 6. Exegesis

<span id="ExA1"><b>A.1</b></span>
  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (<i>qal</i>/<i>niph.</i>), ‘to set free from death or slavery’ (with a ransom price or substitution), occurs just a few times in <i>cultic contexts</i> and is only used of animate objects. The occurrences fall into two groups, in which the second introduces an exception to one provision of the first:   
a) <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (<i>qal</i>) occurs several times in God’s commandments to Moses (Exod 13:13[3x], 15; 34:20) and in the priestly laws (Num 18:15, 17) concerning the consecration of first-born to God, cf. also 4Q270 2 ii:8-9. These laws are said to have been instituted to remember God’s deliverance of
the Israelites from Egypt by slaying all the first-born of the Egyptians, but there was provision for redemption of certain offerings. The first-born of an ass may be redeemed with a lamb (Exod 13:13; 34:20), and likewise every human first-born, although no means of redemption are made explicit (Exod 13:13, 15; 34:20; Num 18:15). Num 18:15 also adds that the first-born of an unclean animal may be redeemed, and the price (<span dir="rtl">פְדוּיָו</span>) is five shekels (Num 18:16). Num
18:17 is a prohibition against the redemption of first-born cows, sheep, and goats, for they are holy. <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> in these contexts means ‘to liberate from death by means of a payment’.   
b) In Lev 27:27, <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (<i>qal</i>/<i>niph.</i>) occurs in parallel with <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>, concerning an unclean animal which may be ransomed at its assessment. Milgrom (2001:2390) seems to make an unnecessary distinction here between <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> and <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>. The basis of his argument is that since all first-born belong to God, <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> would be inappropriate, whereas <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> can be used of redemption by a ‘third party’. However, if this were an important consideration,
why would <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> follow in the subsequent clause rather than <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>? It seems more likely that <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is used primarily because of its associations with
laws concerning the first-born (see above). In Lev 27:29, <span dir="rtl">לֹא יִפָּדֶה</span> is used in a similar way to reinforce the prohibition (<span dir="rtl">לֹא־יִגְאַל</span>) of the previous verse, that humans devoted to the ban may not be redeemed. The wider context for this meaning of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> may be that of buying or re-claiming people or animals offered to God, which is also the semantic ‘territory’ of <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>.

<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (<i>niph.</i>/<i>hiph.</i>/<i>hoph.</i>) occurs in a <i>socio-legal context</i> in Exod 21:8 (cf. 4Q158 7-8:14) and in Lev 19:20. The first concerns a slave-girl who displeases her master and commands that the man should let her be
redeemed (<span dir="rtl">פדה</span> <i>hiph.</i>). The second uses <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> <i>niph.</i> in conjunction with <i>hoph.</i> (emphatic inf.abs.) to describe a slave-girl who has not been ransomed. The person who might redeem her is unspecified, which Stamm
suggests may be the reason for the choice of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> rather than <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> (1976:392). In the previous example (Exod 21:8), however, it seems clear that it would be the girl’s own family who would redeem her (her master is not allowed to sell her to <span dir="rtl">עַם נָכְרִי</span>, ‘a foreign people’). Perhaps, as in the case of Lev 27:27 (above), <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> denotes here a particular kind of ransom used in slavery laws, overlapping with <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>, ‘redemption’.

<b>A.3</b> <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (<i>qal</i>) occurs in a quasi-legal context in 1 Sam 14:45, where the people ‘ransom’ Jonathan’s life from the curse of death which Saul had made (14:24), although there is no mention of how he was ransomed.

<b>A.4</b> <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (<i>qal</i>), ‘to set free without payment’ (God as subject), is used in
the context of <i>past deliverance</i> (2 Sam 4:9; 1 Kgs 1:29; Isa 29:22; Pss 55:19; 71:23; Job 33:28), particularly referring to the Exodus (Deut 7:8; 9:26; 13:6; 15:15; 21:8; 24:18; 2 Sam 7:23 = 1 Chron 17:21; Mic 6:4; Ps 78:42; Neh 1:10; 11Q19 54:16). A significant proportion of these occur with <span dir="rtl">מִן</span> (see below). There are two verses which suggest the means of God’s redemption, neither of which refer to any kind of payment, but rather God’s own greatness and power (Deut 9:26; Neh 1:10). 
Hill (1967:54) warns against the tendency of some scholars to force in the idea of God paying a ransom price when he is the subject of  <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> or <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> by explaining the cost in terms of God’s power, love or self-sacrifice. He suggests that this is just an example of Christian apologetics leading to inaccurate OT theological exegesis. However, in studies of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, it is precisely this lack of ransom-price or exchange which is used to distinguish between the human and divine usage of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (Stamm 1976:396). God does not give anything in exchange when he redeems his people, he always ransoms ‘by grace’ (Tate 1990:198). Jepsen also understands liberation and redemption as a gift of God’s grace, but does not make the distinction between secular and religious uses of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>. He argues that the option of ransom for someone under the death penalty in Exod 21:30 is an example of grace: ‘hier ist Lösung gleich Begnädigung’ (1957:157); cf. the collocation of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> with <span dir="rtl">חנן</span> in Ps 26:11. W. Horbury (personal communication) suggested that it is not a matter of grace: God only withholds ransom payment because he does
not fear retribution from Israel’s human enemies.

<b>A.5</b>   <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (<i>qal</i>/<i>niph.</i>), ‘to (be) set free from 
guilt/condemnation’ is also found in the context of God <i>forgiving</i> the Israelites’ sins in an eschatological context (Isa 1:27; Pss 34:23; 130:8). In Ps 34:23, the idea of God liberating or saving the life of his servants is contrasted with condemnation and guilt (<span dir="rtl">אשׁם</span>). In Isa 1:27, Zion and those who turn back/repent (<span dir="rtl">שׁוב</span>) are the subjects of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> <i>niph.</i>, and the basis of liberation (<span dir="rtl">פדה</span> +  <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>) is justice (<span dir="rtl">משׁפט</span>) and righteousness (<span dir="rtl">צדקה</span>), implying the forgiveness of sins. There are different views about whose justice and righteousness this means, God’s or Zion’s: a thorough review of the issues is provided by Williamson (2006:156-58, cf. 147). The question is complicated by the fact that the verb is passive and the ‘redeemer’ is not explicitly identified. Interpretation of the <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> here as a <i>beth pretii</i> (as in Exod 13:3; 34:20; Lev 27:27; Num 18:6 after <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>) leads to the view that it is ‘because of’ Zion’s practice of justice and righteousness that she is redeemed and both the use of these words earlier in the chapter and the contrast with vv. 28-29 support it. Alternatively <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> may mean ‘by means of’ (as with <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> in Neh 1:10 and probably Deut 9:26) and indicates that God acts in justice and righteousness, as often later in the book (including 4:4 and 5:16). Williamson favours the former view, but notes the importance of repentance in v. 27b and the probability that God is still seen as the redeemer. Ps 130:8 is one of the occurrences of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> with <span dir="rtl">מִן</span> in a promise that God will redeem Israel from all her guilt/iniquities.

<b>A.6</b> <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> with <span dir="rtl">מִן</span>, ‘to set free from enemies, slavery, illness, death’ (God as subject), occurs 17 times. In five of these instances, the context is the Exodus, thus the meaning seems to be ‘to set free’ from the enemy (Ps 78:42), the house of slavery (Deut 7:8; 13:6; Mic 6:4),
the hand/grip of Pharaoh (Deut 7:8) and Egypt (Deut 24:18). <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> occurs in parallelism twice with <span dir="rtl">יצא</span> <i>hiph.</i> (Deut 7:8; 13:6) and once with <span dir="rtl">עלה</span> <i>hiph.</i> (Mic 6:4), which confirms the meaning of ‘liberate’ or ‘rescue’ in <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>. The phrase 
<span dir="rtl">מִן</span> + <span dir="rtl">יַד</span>/ <span dir="rtl">כַּף</span> occurs frequently with <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>. Sometimes the oppressors are human (Deut 7:8; Jer 15:21; Pss 55:18; 119:134; Job 6:23; 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 10:35; 4Q171 1-2ii18; 11Q19 54:16; 59:11) and elsewhere the power is illness or death (Hos 13:14; Ps 49:16; Job 5:20; 33:28; 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 11:19). It is in this sense that the theophorous names  <span dir="rtl">פדי</span> and <span dir="rtl">פדיהו</span> are understood (Stamm 1976:401-02).

<b>A.7</b> <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, ‘to liberate from oppressing forces’ occurs several times with
<span dir="rtl">צר(ה)</span>, which seems to represent general adversity, both individual (2 Sam 4:9; 1 Kgs 1:29) and national (Ps 25:22). Jepsen notes that <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> seems to be used when people need liberating from ‘Bindungen’ (1957:154-57), from which they cannot escape themselves. But Stamm (1976:395) observes that Jepsen’s idea of ‘unsichtbare Bindungen’ is untenable in the light of Exod 21:8, 30; Lev 19:20; Deut 7:8, in which <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is used
to mean ‘Befreiung aus direkter und konkreter menschlicher Macht’ (Stamm 1976:396). However, such a description would perhaps fit in the case of Ps 130:8, where <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> + <span dir="rtl">מִן</span> is used for liberation from iniquities.

<b>A.8</b>  D.J. Reimer (personal communication) has drawn attention to the striking fact that, in addition to seven further occurrences in the Psalter, six Psalms have forms of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> in their final (25:22; 34:23; 44:27; 130:8) or penultimate (26:11; 71:23) verses. They include two cases where the psalm is acrostic and the verse in question stands outside the alphabetic pattern (25:22; 34:23). Whether or not they are secondary additions, this certainly makes for a finale here in which a concern with ‘redemption’ is particularly prominent. In Psalm 130 <span dir="rtl">פדות</span> also occurs in v. 7. In half the cases the verb expresses a request (25:22; 26:11; 44:27), in one a past rescue (71:23), in one a confident hope (130:8) and in one a general truth (34:23). The beneficiaries may be the psalmist(s) (26:11; 44:27; 71:23), ‘Israel’ (25:22; 130:8) or Yahweh’s ‘servants’ (34:23). Redemption is sought from troubles in general (25:22: <span dir="rtl">צרות</span>), sin and judgement (34:23; 130:8), or enemies (71:23). There is therefore some diversity of focus and situation in the use of the shared concept. Further research into this and into correlations with other uses of the root would be very worthwhile. 

<b>A.9</b>  Qumran has some unusual uses of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>:   
a) The <i>qal</i> act.part. <span dir="rtl">פודך</span>, ‘your redeemer’, appears as a title for God in 11Q5 22:15. Although this is a very common occurrence with other verbs in the semantic field, such as <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> <i>hiph.</i> and <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>, the act.part. of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> occurs only twice in the OT and never as a title.   
b) In the Damascus Document (CD-A 16:8) <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is used of an oath which cannot be ‘redeemed’, that is, it cannot be revoked or invalidated, even if the consequence (‘price’) is death. This idea is not found in the OT usage of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>. The opposite to this (CD-A 16:9) is <span dir="rtl">קום</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘fulfil’.
Given the connotations of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, a monetary payment in substitution might be involved (cf. bNed. 28a-8: Rabin 1954:76).  
c) <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is also used at Qumran of a <i>future liberation</i>, of the Priest and his followers (4Q171 1-2 ii:18), the exiled Jews (11Q19 59:11-12) and ‘you’ with unclear reference (6Q59:1).


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>  The general sense of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> seems to be very broad, namely, ‘to liberate’. Stamm argues that the ‘original’ meaning of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is found in the context of liberation and deliverance (supported by early texts: 2
Sam 4:9; 1 Kgs 1:29; Hos 7:13; 13:14) and was only later adopted by socio-legal language. He suggests this by analogy with Akk. <i>paṭāru</i> (1976:397) which is also found in both legal and general contexts. However, the fact that the specific socio-legal and cultic uses of  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> and the emphasis on exchange or monetary ransom are not found when God is the subject (except Ps 49:8, see above), seems to support Jepsen’s
argument for a general meaning ‘lösen’ underlying both uses.

<b>A.2</b>  The socio-legal and cultic uses of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, however, are very specific, and they sometimes seem to overlap with <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>. The uses of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> in these contexts seem to indicate that it means ‘to liberate by means of a ransom’ from either slavery or death. <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> occurs several times with <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> in cultic contexts, which conveys the idea of giving something in exchange. The nouns <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span>, ‘ransom, means of liberation’, and <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span>, ‘ransom price of human life’, bring out this meaning of giving something in exchange for freedom. Although the idea of payment is present in <span dir="rtl">גאל</span> (in non-theological uses), the emphasis on giving something of equivalent value seems to be particularly important to the meaning of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>, perhaps because  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> has a distinctive use for the ransoming of first-born and for human life.

<b>A.3</b> <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> + <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> in theological contexts emphasizes God’s power to redeem and deliver (e.g., Deut 9:26; Neh 1:10). The force of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (when God is the subject) is in the action of deliverance. This is confirmed by the noun <span dir="rtl">פדות</span>, which has the sense of ‘(power of) liberation’. The contexts
for the theological uses of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> are both individual and national deliverance from oppressing forces, from which they cannot escape themselves. In a few cases, <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> is also used in the context of liberation from guilt and condemnation.

<b>A.4</b> <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> occurs many times with the preposition <span dir="rtl">מִן</span> + <span dir="rtl">כף</span>/ <span dir="rtl">יד</span>, which
emphasizes the nature of liberation as being a transfer away from an oppressing power, whether illness, death, human enemies or danger. This has parallels with several ‘deliverance’ words: <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i>, <span dir="rtl">מלט</span> <i>piel</i>, <span dir="rtl">יצא</span> <i>hiph.</i>, and <span dir="rtl">עלה</span> <i>hiph.</i> and (less often) <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>, which reinforce the sense of ‘deliverance’, particularly in the context of the Exodus.
