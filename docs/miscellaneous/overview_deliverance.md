## Introduction
Much of the work that is summarised here was done between 1998 and 2001,
when Dr James Aitken and (for one year) Dr Peter Williams were full-time
researchers at the Cambridge Centre of the SAHD project. In the summer
of 2005 Mrs (now Dr) Alison Gray added two further sets of entries on
the basis of her MPhil thesis (Cambridge, 2004). At a later stage (from
2012) Dr Gray made valuable contributions to the completion of the three
large entries for the עזר group, and Dr Kim Phillips and Mr William Ross
used their linguistic and technical expertise to convert Hebrew, Greek
and transliterated text in the old entries into Unicode. 

The Centre is
most grateful to the Leverhulme Trust, the Jerusalem Trust, the British
Academy, the Hort Fund of the Cambridge Faculty of Divinity and the
Cambridge Humanities Research Grants Scheme for the grants which made
this work possible. We are also very grateful to colleagues on the SAHD
Executive Committee, especially Professor H.G.M. Williamson, for their
careful reviews of the drafts of these entries which were submitted to
them and for many helpful suggestions that they made for improvement.
Whatever gaps, errors and inconsistencies may remain are our
responsibility and not theirs. Other work of the centre has been published in Muraoka 1998; Aitken 2007; and on the project’s websites.[^1]

Entries have been completed for the verbs
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הציל</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזר</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span>, 
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span> 
   in all conjugations, together with nouns from the same
roots. Originally (following John F.A. Sawyer) we called the group of lexemes that
we are studying ‘words for salvation’. But ‘salvation’ has too many
connotations of the inner, spiritual life to be suitable as a term for
the linguistic description of classical Hebrew words which most often
relate to the external circumstances of the individual or the people
(German ‘Heil’ is not so problematic, perhaps). The word ‘deliverance’
is therefore now used instead, and it may be defined as ‘an action
(normally performed by a different person) for the benefit of persons
who are in danger or trouble’.  

It is important to say that we are dealing with words that have such a 
<i>meaning</i>. There are other words which can <i>refer to</i> actions 
of such a
kind, although their meaning is somewhat different: for example, הוציא,
‘bring out’, or העלה, ‘bring up’, with reference to the Exodus, שׁפט,
‘judge’ and רפא, ‘heal’. We do not include them. There are also various
metaphors that may be used to represent deliverance, especially when the
trouble is itself described metaphorically, as in Ps 18:17:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He (Yahweh) reached down from on high, he took me;  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he drew me out of mighty waters (ימשׁני ממים רבים, root משׁה). Cf. v. 5.

Again we do not include these. All of them belong to what 
Sawyer called the wider ‘associative field’ of words for deliverance or
salvation (see below). It is fully recognised that such related words
and (especially in poetry) metaphors play an important part in ancient
Hebrew accounts of deliverance. We hope that our work on the ‘plainer’
and more general expressions studied here will contribute to further
study of the related words and metaphors, and also that such study will
provide useful confirmation or correctives for the conclusions which we
have reached.[^2]

## Previous work

An obvious starting-point is the monograph of Sawyer (1972),
<i>Semantics in Biblical Research: New Methods of Defining Hebrew Words
for Salvation</i>, together with some related articles of 
his (Sawyer 1965; 1967; 1968; 1975).[^3] The
monograph’s title reflects its double aim: in Sawyer’s words ‘what
started out as an analysis of several biblical terms became, as it were,
a practical guide to describing the meaning of OT Hebrew’ (1972:2). Here
we are mainly concerned with the former, narrower task, though Sawyer’s
views about more general issues naturally inform his specific
discussions and conclusions and will need to be referred to as well.
Under the wider heading of ‘context’ Sawyer notes the need to attend to
different ‘registers’ and ‘styles’ of a language and he chooses to
examine in detail only occurrences of ‘salvation-words’ in texts which
directly address God (the prayer ‘register’). These he subdivides
between six ‘styles’, which are defined initially by their introductory
verbs and in cases where there is none by similarity of form and content
(1972:17-27, with a table on p. 27). Here Sawyer is only concerned with
what he will later call the ‘lexical group’ of salvation-words which are
‘very closely related to one another (1972:30): 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הציל</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">חלץ</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזר</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פצה</span>, 
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>,
and the Biblical Hebrew nouns etymologically related
to them. 

[^3]: An important earlier work of synthesis is Stamm 1940.


Before examining these words in detail, however, Sawyer devotes
a chapter to a much wider group of lexemes which he calls ‘the
associative field of HOŠIAʿ’ (1972:29-58), an expression derived from the
ideas of F. de Saussure and J. Trier: ‘a word’s associative field
includes terms related to it at all levels (for instance synonyms,
opposites, terms that rhyme with it or look like it)’ (1972:30). Sawyer’s
wider group contains some 200 items, which he classifies under 13
headings derived from the meaning or social context of each item (see
the table on p. 37): many are words used in a metaphorical sense.
Although this collection of lexemes is acknowledged to be based largely
on intuition (1972:33-35), its value for ‘a general study of OT language
about salvation’ and its advantages over (as often elsewhere) a focus on
a single word or root are properly noted. Among the words studied by us
גאל and פדה have their place within this wider ‘field’, but they are not
given any particular prominence.

It is in chapters 4, 5 and 6 (1972:60-101) that Sawyer turns his
attention to the narrower lexical group. Here the ideas of John Lyons’s
<i>Structural Semantics</i> (1963) and Noam Chomsky’s transformational
grammar (in the treatment of nouns: see 1972:62-67) are more influential.
The approaches of the three chapters are clearly distinguished by their
titles: ‘Synchronic Description’, ‘Historical Description’ and
‘Definition’. It is noted that הושׁיע and its related nouns (the latter
actually outnumbering forms of the verb) are by far the most frequent
members of the group in the ‘prayer register’, and the only ones to
appear in prophetic examples of it. They have a wider associative field
(including metaphors: 1972:54, 68-69) than, for example, הציל, which in
this register also has no nominalisations. On the other hand Sawyer
claims that הושׁיע is less frequently transitive compared with other
verbs in the group (this might be disputed) and the rarity of a
following מן (only 4 times out of 38 in the register) makes the element
of separation less prominent in its uses than elsewhere (cf. the table
on p. 73). 

As for paradigmatic relations, Sawyer concentrates on
reference (i.e. the extra-lingual feature referred to, as indicated by
the wider context: 1972:77) and opposition. Most of the evidence for the
former is in fact drawn from the words’ syntagmatic relations (subject,
object etc.). In the prayer register the subject of הושׁיע is always
Yahweh except in Hos 14:4, and this is generally the case with הציל
(the exception is Isa 44:17 where an idol/foreign god is so addressed).
Of course such a limitation could well be due to the choice of register.
עזר is used with a human ‘subject’ in Judg 5:23, which is taken to
indicate its ‘more general application’ – a conclusion which is indeed
borne out by its usage elsewhere (1972:81), but scarcely by the limited
evidence in the register taken alone. The object is always the speaker
or his community (again this is not surprising in the register), and
where specified is sometimes its leadership (though only with הושׁיע, as
it happens). The danger ‘from’ which someone is removed is generally the
speaker’s enemies (once חמס as a [superficially] generic term) with all
the words examined. Among other meaning-relations opposition (the
favourite of structural linguists) is generally the most illuminating,
and Sawyer’s examples produce the following oppositions: 
for
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span>
there are 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">השפיל</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מות</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">נפל</span> 
(sc. into the hands of enemies), קצר (probably),
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">נדהם</span>,
and
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שקר</span>;
for the other words there is only (for עזר) כחש.
As Sawyer
points out, these words connect with specific aspects (‘components’?) of
the meaning of the words in the group, some relating to the subject and
some to the treatment of the object: between them they narrow down (but
do not completely determine) the meaning. Further help is provided by
consequences (blessing, praise, security), implication (by way 
of a
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">כי</span>–clause) and poetic parallelism, 
the last indicating a relation to
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">ענה</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שמע</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">רפא</span>,
 which suggests ‘readiness to intervene’ and ‘general
health, physical and spiritual’ as central aspects of הושׁיע in contrast
to the ideas of separation or removal which characterise the other
members of the group. These are at any rate helpful leads, even if only
to part of the definition desired.

The ‘historical description’ in chapter 5 includes some reference to
wider etymological relations outside Biblical Hebrew, and so represents
a partial departure from the position of James Barr on this issue
(see Barr 1961:107-160; and e.g. Barr 2014a; 2014b.).<!--[^4]-->
But this does not extend to an acceptance of the long-popular but now
generally discarded association of הושׁיע with Arabic <i>wasiʿa</i>, ‘be wide,
spacious’: Sawyer accepts the evidence from Ugaritic and Epigraphic
South Arabian that the second consonant of the root was originally <i>t</i>
and not <i>s</i> (Sawyer 1972:93-94; 
cf. also Sawyer 1975).<!--[^5] -->
Unfortunately the extra-biblical occurrences of the root
are so far all in proper names, so they add nothing significant to our
understanding of its meaning(s). From an examination of its usage within
and beyond the prayer register Sawyer concludes that הושׁיע (i) ‘is
applied almost exclusively to divine intervention or the activity of
divinely appointed agents such as kings and judges’ (1972:94) and (ii)
often has a ‘forensic’ meaning, though not necessarily a forensic origin
(1972:95). These features are also evident in post-biblical Hebrew. הציל
and עזר (for which עדר occasionally occurs as a loan from Aramaic), on
the other hand, have no special religious connotations, and this
continues to be the case in later phases of Hebrew. The notion of
separation appears with both verbs, much more frequently with the
former. Sawyer treats מלט (which occurs only in Hebrew) as a by-form of
the more widely attested פלט and notes its occurrence in the passive
(Niphal) and the rarity of a divine subject with it, which fits in with
its rarity in the Psalms. In later Hebrew it becomes the preferred form
for ‘rescue, escape’. Finally, three rarer words are discussed, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">חלץ</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פצה</span>,
the latter two being seen, in the meaning ‘save’, as loans from
Aramaic.

The final chapter on the lexical group (ch. 6, ‘Definition’) helpfully
identifies the oppositions between different terms as regards frequency,
nominalisation, transitivity, separation and religious context, and
presents this information in three different ways, including a series of
block diagrams (1972:111). The conclusions vary slightly, but according to
Sawyer not significantly, depending on whether occurrences in the
register alone (1972:103-05) or throughout the OT (1972:105-11) are being
considered.

Detailed comments on some of Sawyer’s conclusions will follow in the
summary of our own results later on. A few general points may be made
here. Sawyer’s attention to ‘register’ is important, and similar to the
concept of ‘functional languages’ used by the Florence centre of SAHD.
But the examination of only one register in detail, however
understandable for the doctoral dissertation on which Sawyer’s book was
based, becomes a serious handicap when the meanings of words that occur
frequently elsewhere have to be determined. (It is perhaps less of a
problem for the development of an appropriate <i>method</i> for the semantic
study of Biblical Hebrew, which is Sawyer’s other aim.) Sawyer is aware
of this and, as noted, some of his discussion takes account of
occurrences outside the prayer register. But without more detailed study
it is not clear whether one can have confidence that (some of) his
conclusions do in fact apply to the Biblical Hebrew corpus as a whole,
or indeed even to the prayer register itself, since the data there are
sometimes very limited in extent. Further, the inclusion of information
about meanings in rabbinic, medieval and modern Hebrew is interesting
and may sometimes confirm or suggest trends in the development of
meanings, but it is curious that virtually no attention is paid to
ancient Hebrew inscriptions, the Hebrew text of Ben Sira and the Dead
Sea Scrolls, which arguably are much more relevant for the study of
Biblical Hebrew.[^6]

[^6]: I pass by here the important assessment of Sawyer’s work by Zatelli 1979:261-68, which tends to be appreciative of (some of) Sawyer’s results (e.g. 2017:267) but more critical of his pragmatic and eclectic methodology.


A wider range of occurrences of the words in question is reviewed in the
major theological dictionaries of the OT that have appeared since
1970 (<i>THAT/ TLOT</i>; <i>ThWAT/ TDOT</i>, <i>NICOTTE</i>).[^7] 
Their articles on the words studied here will be briefly
surveyed, with special reference to controversial issues, before an
overview of the SAHD entries themselves is given.

Westermann (eds), <i>Theologisches Handwörterbuch zum Alten Testament</i> (Munich: Chr. Kaiser, and Zürich: Theologischer Verlag, 1971, 1976) (<i>THAT</i> / <i>TLOT</i>); W.A. VanGemeren (ed.), <i>New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis</i> (Carlisle: Paternoster, 1996) (<i>NIDOTTE</i>). The occurrences in the Qumran texts are now much more fully treated in H.-J. Fabry & U. Dahmen (eds), <i>Theologisches Wörterbuch zu den Qumrantexten</i>, (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 2011-16) (<i>ThWQ</i>).



<u>1. הושׁיע.</u>   
<a id="SawyerThWAT"></a>
There is widespread support for the idea that ‘help’ is the
primary or basic meaning, though <i>NIDOTTE</i> continues to use the
traditional equivalent ‘salvation’ to excess and is too focussed on
theological uses (even for a theological dictionary!). <i>THAT</i> (Stolz 1978) is the best
on the references to human ‘help’, and also highlights the cultic and
eschatological uses well, in addition to a possible <i>Heimat</i> (for the
religious use?) in Holy War traditions. Sawyer (1982) in 
<i>ThWAT</i> reaffirms his
emphasis on forensic usage (as in his book), but now seems to see it as
dependent upon the general theological uses of the word.

<u>2. הציל.</u>  
The core meaning is seen as ‘take away’, though <i>THAT</i> (Bergmann 1978) 
qualifies
this to mean ‘from a place’ rather than ‘out of’. This may be behind
<i>NIDOTTE</i>’s point that the action may be preventative as well as a rescue
from an actual situation of trouble. <i>NIDOTTE</i> derives a nuance of
‘snatching away’ from the conjugations other than the Hiphil. Contrasts
with הושׁיע are noted in <i>ThWAT</i> (Hossfeld and Kalthoff 1986)
and <i>THAT</i>, and also with פלט in the latter.
Emphasis is laid on the use with a divine subject, but the statistics in
<i>THAT</i> show that this applies to little more than half the occurrences.

<u>3. עזר.</u>  
The idea of ‘help’ is explicated by <i>ThWAT</i> (Lipiński and Fabry 1989) as involving
cooperation of both parties, in a distinction from other words in the
group, and as possibly involving an enduring state, as in alliances
(deduced from the nouns?). The idea of ‘protection’ is sometimes
prominent according to <i>THAT</i> (Bergmann 1978b) and <i>NIDOTTE</i>. 
Both <i>ThWAT</i> and <i>NIDOTTE</i>  pick up
the frequent occurrences in Chronicles, to the virtual exclusion of
הושׁיע and הציל
 - one wonders why this might be. 
עזר
 continues to be
common in Deutero-Isaiah and the Psalms as a way of multiplying
synonyms.


<u>4. חלץ.</u>   
<i>NIDOTTE</i> sees ‘removal’ as the central idea, but makes little
attempt to correlate the individual senses with this. <i>ThWAT</i> gives a very
fragmented account of the word, but does note that it rarely has any
direct reference to affliction or trouble (so that the emphasis is on
the benefit to the person?).


<u>5. פלט / מלט.</u>   
The general view is that מלט is a special Hebrew
derivation from פלט. This conclusion sits a little awkwardly with the
intra-Hebrew distribution of the words, which makes occurrences of פלט
mainly ‘late’, as seen by <i>NIDOTTE</i>. <i>ThWAT</i> (Hasel 1989:598) identifies a
distinction from הושׁיע (from Jenni), 
with the latter being viewed as a
subsequent action (or is it a summary word?). The distinction between
מלט and פלט
 (see below on <a href="#Williams">Williams</a>) is already there in essence in
all three articles, though <i>THAT</i> (Ruprecht 1978) 
claims that there is no distinction of
meaning when they are used in parallel, and <i>NIDOTTE</i> finds evidence of
both ‘from’ and ‘to’ with פלט . For מלט it suggests ‘slip away safely’
as basic. The idea of ‘escape’ is central, but this is obscured by 
LXX’s use of σῴζω.


<u>6. פצה.</u>   
Only <i><i>NIDOTTE</i></i> deals with it: the normal sense is ‘open’, and
only Psalm 144 extends this to ‘deliver’.

<u>7. פרק.</u>   
The nuance of ‘force’ is well recognised in <i>ThWAT</i> (Reiterer 1989) and 
<i>NIDOTTE</i> and <!-- NB Check stijl!!!-->
helps to distinguish it. There is no entry for it in <i>THAT</i>. <i>NIDOTTE</i>
also sees ‘separation’ as involved in some cases (nouns in 1 Samuel 4 and
Obad. 14; also the Daniel 4 BAram. occurrence).


<u>8. גאל.</u>   
There is a notable difference between <i>ThWAT</i> (Ringgren 1973), which sees the
general use as basic, and <i>THAT</i> (Stamm 1978a) and <i>NIDOTTE</i>, which make the legal
use original. <i>NIDOTTE</i> has a good distinction between the technical legal
uses in Leviticus and a general reference to family responsibility, as
in Ruth and elsewhere. The main distinctions from פדה are the ideas of
‘reclaiming’ and the involvement of a family member (which could be
connected).


<u>9. פדה.</u>  
The same issue about development surfaces here, with both <i>ThWAT</i> (Cazelles 1989)
and <i>THAT</i> (Stamm 1978b) making the legal use primary, in the latter case
specifically in the case of trade; whereas <i>NIDOTTE</i> follows Jepsen in
tracing this back to a more general usage. Despite this, curiously,
<i>NIDOTTE</i> uses the word ‘ransom’ much too often. <i>ThWAT</i> makes a lot of the
connection with כפר (via the nouns), but the evidence against this is
well assembled in <i>NIDOTTE</i>.


## The SAHD Entries


The lexemes in this group which have so far been investigated by the
SAHD centre in Cambridge[^8] correspond to the most widely attested members
of Sawyer’s inner ‘lexical group’, plus 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>. Among the less
frequent members of the inner group we have not (yet) dealt with חלץ and
פצה , but we recently decided to include פרק , mainly because of the
widespread use of its Aramaic cognate to render various members of the
lexical group in the Targums and the Peshitta. גאל and פדה were placed
by Sawyer in the wider ‘associative’ field of words for salvation, but
we have included them because at least some of their uses come very
close to those of the words in the inner group, as Sawyer himself
acknowledges (1972:36; cf. 57). It is not entirely clear why he
excluded them from the inner group, but he was clearly convinced by the
view that their general theological use is a metaphorical development
from originally legal expressions (1972:54-55) and perhaps this was the
reason. If so, the argument is weakened, for him at least, by the idea
that הושׁיע itself ‘was originally a forensic term’.[^9] Our own decision
to include them finds some support in <i>NIDOTTE</i>’s definition of the
semantic field of ‘salvation’ (5:165-66): it also includes שָׂרִיד,
‘remnant’, presumably because of its relationship to nouns from the root
פלט
(though oddly not שְׁאֵרִית), and also שָׁלוֹם, whose semantic
relationship to ישׁועה and related words certainly deserves
consideration. Such a study might also make reference to Aitken’s
entry on ברכה.

[^8]: For a valuable general introduction to the aims and method of the SAHD project and the different parts of the ‘framework’ of entries see Aitken 2007:23-41.
[^9]: Sawyer 1972:54. In his <i>ThWAT</i> article he appears to move away from this view, as noted <a href="#SawyerThWAT">above</a>.



This overview of the entries will proceed in three stages. It will begin
with the general conclusions reached in the various entries. The second
section will provide a comparison between the findings about the ancient
versions. Finally we shall seek to relate these findings to the general
view taken of each lexeme and add some concluding observations.


### 1. Specific conclusions


<b>a.</b>  הושׁיע: We concur with the general view that the etymological
derivation of its meaning from the idea of ‘spaciousness’ has been
disproved. This idea does feature in one associated metaphor (Sawyer),
but it makes no special contribution to the verb’s meaning. There are no
obvious ‘concrete’ uses from which it might be deduced (unless √שׁוּעַ
were a by-form and had a specific reference to ‘wealth’). In its many
occurrences (202x in BHeb.) the verb expresses ‘the bringing of
<i>assistance</i> to someone in need, in military, civil and judicial
contexts’. No one of these areas has a clear priority, and Sawyer’s
earlier suggestion that the ‘forensic’ use is basic should be rejected.
הושׁיע can, in wisdom literature, refer to an increase in prosperity or
wealth, and occasionally in the Psalms and elsewhere also to defence,
i.e. protection in advance from enemy attack. Use with מן is
comparatively low (c. 23x, 12%) and Sawyer’s conclusion about its low
‘transitivity’ should be noted (and perhaps 
re-examined): these features
suggest that the focus of the verb is on the agent or the action rather
than the beneficiary or the danger/need.   
Related nouns account for another 180 or so occurrences in BHeb., the great
majority being instances of three nouns:
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">יֵשַׁע</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">יְשׁוּעָה</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּשׁוּעָה</span>.
Their distribution is especially heavy in poetry (whereas the verb has
over 35% of its occurrences in prose), mainly in the Psalms and Isaiah,
though 11 of the 37 occurrences of תְּשׁוּעָה are in prose. All of them
more often refer to a <i>state</i> of security than to an action that brings
it about, and among them only יְשׁוּעָה exhibits a plural 
form (12x in BHeb.; also the hapax מוֹשָׁעָה). יֵשַׁע is particularly common in
descriptions of God, and it hardly ever refers to an action. תְּשׁוּעָה
is not used at Qumran, unlike the other two nouns, but it does occur 3x
in Ben Sira (and also in MHeb.). It is commonly derived from √שׁוּעַ, but
without good reason: its meaning seems to be indistinguishable from 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">יְשׁוּעָה</span>.
The other two nouns (possibly) derived from √שׁוּעַ
 (otherwise
it occurs only in PNs) seem to mean ‘great man’ (שׁוֹעַ: at least in the
two clear cases) and ‘cry for help’ (שׁוּעַ: this is probably derived
from שָׁוַע, like שׁוֹעַ in Isa 22:5) and provide no basis for a
connection between the two roots.


<b>b.</b>  עזר: This is the general Hebrew word for ‘help’, but it is only about
half as common as הושׁיע and its related nouns. Its generality and wide
range of contexts of use mean that it could be regarded as the
‘superordinate’ expression to which other words in the group relate as
hyponyms. On the other hand, it has some distinctive characteristics –
the perhaps surprising frequency of verbs of motion with the noun עזרה
and the infrequency of constructions with מן (though it may be more
surprising that there are any at all).


<b>c.</b>  הציל: This root is represented almost entirely by verbal forms, in no
less than five conjugations. The noun הצלה occurs only once in BHeb., in
Esther (LBHeb.), but it became common in MHeb. By far the most common
conjugation is the Hiphil (219x), in which the meaning is most often the
deliverance of people from danger to safety. Rarer uses refer to the
removal and occasionally the recovery (compare here גאל and also שׁוב
Hiph.) of objects from one place to another. Association with מן is very
frequent. The Niphal provides the passive of the main sense, whereas the
Hophal (3x) is the passive of ‘removal’. The Piel (4x) and Hithpael (1x)
also generally represent this sense. From these data one could
reasonably deduce a basic sense of ‘remove’, whose prime specialisation
(which became the dominant use) was for ‘deliverance from danger’, with
a much rarer specialisation to ‘recovery’.


<a id="Williams"></a><b>d.</b>  מלט and פלט: Our entry on פלט (by Williams) 
points out that it
is the Piel forms of the verb (34x) and the related nouns (c. 60x) which
account for the great majority of the occurrences. The Qal, Niphal (only
at Qumran) and Hiphil are all rare. Williams argues that, as partly
observed in earlier studies, the meaning is overwhelmingly ‘bring to
safety’ (so that LXX σῴζω is a very appropriate equivalent; 
Williams 2002).  <!--[^10] -->  
He observes that the process of rescue from danger or trouble is reflected
in what may be imagined as a semantic ‘line’, with the idea of escape
from hostile forces at one end and arrival at a place of safety at the
other. פלט corresponds predominantly to the latter, while מלט occupies
the opposite end of the line, i.e. the sense ‘escape’ (in the Niphal) or
‘rescue’. The argument is supported by observations about the frequency
of nominal forms and PNs (indicating a settled state) from the root פלט
in contrast to their rarity with מלט, by the striking difference in the
proportions of occurrences associated with מן (69% with מלט, but only
12% with פלט: noted already by Sawyer 1972:108) and
syntagmatic relations with words such as נוס and ברח. These observations
undermine the common view that the verbs מלט and פלט are ‘complementary’
but essentially synonymous, with מלט supplying the passive forms and פלט
the nominalisation. The fact that both verbs occur, in almost equal
numbers, in the Piel should have already suggested that this was not the
whole story.  
The entry on מלט (by Aitken) notes that its Niphal is over twice as
frequent as its Piel (72x vs. 35x), while the Hiphil and Hithpael are
both rare. The use of the Hiphil for childbirth and the Hithpael for
emission or escape could seem to support Williams’s argument. But with
the Niphal (which is unattested for פלט in BHeb.) directional morphemes as
well as constructions with מן are found, suggesting that in this passive
conjugation there is more of an overlap between the meanings of the two
verbs. Williams’s full account makes some allowance for this in a
different way by recognising some ‘moments’ on the semantic ‘line’ to
which both verbs could refer, even though the predominant focus in each
case is on the opposite ends of it. Aitken has identified a structural
reason for one such overlap.


<b>e.</b>  גאל: There has been much debate about the semantics of this word (see
above). Our entry (by Alison Gray) concludes that the basic meaning is
‘to act as a kinsman’ \[we should add ‘for the benefit of another’ here]
(hence the nominalised use of the participle גֹּאֵל), from which there
developed the specialised legal senses of ‘buy or claim back, redeem’
(which generated the cultic use for ‘buy back [not as a kinsman] from
God’) and then ‘avenge’ (bloodshed: hence the expression גֹּאֵל־הַדָּם).
The theological uses (which include that of the nominalised participle
גֹּאֵל) derive not from these legal and cultic senses but from the
original more general meaning and attracted in some cases the
construction with מן from verbs with a related meaning. This development
can be clarified by distinguishing [kin], [buy] and [claim back] as the
semantic components of the verb. The noun גאלה relates only to the
cultic and legal meanings in BHeb., but its use is widened at Qumran and in
other post-biblical occurrences to include a theological reference. The
one occurrence of גאלים probably has (legal) redemption in view, though
‘vengeance’ is also a possibility.


<b>f.</b>  פדה: Again there has been much debate about this group of words. Our
entry (also by Gray) concludes that the general meaning
‘liberate’ is basic (with Jepsen and against Stamm, who sees the
theological usage as dependent upon and affected by the legal uses). In
legal texts it means release as the result of a ransom payment or the
death of an animal (or, at Qumran, an oath). In theological uses it can
express deliverance from enemies (like גאל and including, in
Deuteronomy, at the Exodus) and occasionally from sin and the
construction with מן is sometimes found. But there is no allusion there
to an associated payment or death. Among the nouns פדות is confined to
theological contexts (it is very common at Qumran) and represents the
act of deliverance. The other two nouns, פדוים and פדיון, both stand for
the ransom price that is paid and indicate how central this is to the
legal uses of the verb. פדוים is used in cultic contexts, but פדיון is
not. As a cultic term פדה is indistinguishable from and interchangeable
with the weakened sense of גאל and is also used of ‘buying back’ an
animal or person from God, but elsewhere the kin-relatedness of גאל
makes the meanings of the two verbs clearly distinct.


<b>g.</b>  פרק: Only three occurrences of this verb and its related nouns (plus
one in BAram.) belong to the semantic field of
salvation/deliverance. In the majority of its uses it refers to the
violent removal of an object, or part of an object, not a person: so
‘tear off’. The noun פֶּרֶק, ‘plunder’ is clearly related to this
meaning. Other nouns refer to bones or joints, probably as ‘broken’
parts of the body of a human or an animal. Where the verb is used with a
personal object, the idea of violent removal could still be present,
although this is generally not recognised in modern translations. In
Aramaic the verb is much more widely used with a personal object in
senses such as ‘save, redeem’ (hence its popularity as a rendering of
other words in the lexical group), and another possibility is that the
Hebrew occurrences referred to above, three of which are certainly
exilic or later, reflect the influence of the Aramaic verb.


### 2. The renderings in the Ancient Versions

An important element of our work is the extensive analysis of the
renderings given to these words in the ancient Versions. This could
provide something akin to the ‘testimony of the native speaker’ which is
regarded by linguists as invaluable in the study of semantics and
especially for distinguishing the nuances of closely related terms. Of
course the native speakers concerned would be those who lived some time
after the texts in question were composed (in most cases at least), but
the fact that in their translations they were usually trying to
represent what the words meant in the older biblical texts might in
theory preserve a true memory of how they had been understood in earlier
times.

Only the broad tendencies of the translators will be summarised here,
even though detailed examination of individual instances (and rarer
renderings) might well shed valuable light on the distinctions of
meaning that need to be made. Two approaches to the data will be
followed in turn: first an overview of the renderings in each of the
Versions taken separately, with some study of the distinctions in
meaning between their most favoured equivalents; and then a
consideration of how each word(-group) is rendered by all the versions
and what this might indicate for the understanding of it in the early
post-biblical period. As far as we know, the project’s synthetic studies
may be the first time that such a ‘lexical field’ study of versional
renderings has been done.[^11] It should be a valuable approach for the
study of the Versions themselves, as well as for the semantics of the
underlying Hebrew. There are of course considerable pitfalls and
difficulties in the use of the Versions for any kind of study of the
Hebrew Bible itself, and the warnings of Aitken (2007:30-31)
need to be noted. What follows is only a preliminary and provisional
account of what they may have to offer in this particular case.

[^11]: Cf. Aitken 2007:30-37. He refers to Muraoka’s essay (1995b), as a rare predecessor, and also to Grabbe 1977.



#### (i) The Versions Separately

<b>LXX</b>: In the LXX the following equivalents are the main ones used.

σῴζω is the clear preference for הושׁיע etc. and מלט (the latter
especially with the Niphal). It also appears occasionally for 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזר</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הציל</span>, 
(esp. with the Niphal), פלט (where it is preferred by the Three) 
and <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>.  
It has a wide range of meaning, including ‘save from death’, ‘keep safe’
and in the passive ‘be healed’ and ‘escape’. The associated nouns are
often used in a religious sense.

βοηθέω is regularly used for עזר etc., but also for הושׁיע. 
It means ‘help’, but also sometimes ‘come to the rescue’.

ἐξαιρέω is one of the common equivalents for הציל, and it is also used
for מלט and פלט. 
It means ‘take out, take from’, and also ‘remove’, often in a negative
sense but also (in the middle acc. LSJ) for ‘set free’.

<span lang="el">ῥύομαι</span> is the other main equivalent for הציל and it is preferred for
פלט. It sometimes appears as a rendering for הושׁיע and מלט, and
occasionally for גאל (mainly in Isaiah where the subject is God) and
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>. 
Its meaning in classical and later Greek is mainly ‘rescue, set free’
and even ‘redeem’ (the sense ‘protect, defend’ is virtually confined to
Homer). Unlike ἐξαιρέω, therefore, it is entirely used of a positive
outcome.

λυτρόω/ομαι is the most common equivalent for גאל and פדה, with the
difference that ἀγχιστεύω, ‘to be next of kin’, is also frequently used
for גאל but not for פדה. λυτρόω/ομαι is also used for the cases of פרק
which have a personal object, no doubt because of the sense ‘redeem’
which that verb had in Aramaic. 
The meaning is ‘release on receipt of a ransom’ in the active and
‘release by the payment of a ransom, redeem’ in the middle.

The favoured Septuagintal renderings point to an affinity between the
meanings attributed to הושׁיע and מלט and to a lesser extent between
הושׁיע and עזר. The rendering of the former pair by σῴζω (and less often
by ῥύομαι) reflects their strong expression of benefit to the object of
the action and also attributes to them an element of rescue or escape.
It is possible that the occasional use of βοηθέω for הושׁיע (but not מלט)
gives some recognition to its stronger focus on benefit than danger.

The choice of ῥύομαι for הציל and פלט lends to them both its positive
sense of ‘set free’. ἐξαιρέω is also used frequently for הציל and less
often for פלט, and its own possession of a positive sense fits in with
this. Possibly its neutral and negative senses are responsible for its
frequency with הציל, since the latter also has such senses in a minority
of cases. In other words the LXX may indicate an awareness of ‘remove’
as well as ‘rescue’ in the meanings of הציל.

Finally the use of λυτρόω/ομαι for גאל and פדה reflects the place of a
payment in many instances of these verbs, though the use of other verbs
recognises that this is not universal and the examples of ἀγχιστεύω for
גאל help to identify a linguistic component that distinguishes these two
verbs.

[Our data on the <i>Jewish revisers</i> are unfortunately still patchy (with
none at all on הושׁיע and הציל; but for the latter they tend towards
ῥύομαι rather than ἐξαιρέω).[^12] The distinction between גאל and פדה by
the use of ἀγχιστεύω for the former is more frequent in them. For פלט
Aquila has διασῴζω regularly, while Symmachus prefers ῥύομαι or
compounds of φεύγω, none of which appears for מלט in the meagre data
that we have for it.]

[^12]: For some data on הציל see Davies 1982:154.


<b>Vulgate</b>: The pattern of renderings is very similar to the LXX, quite
likely through the mediation of the Old Latin. But there are one or two
notable differences.

<i>salvo</i> is regularly used for הושׁיע and for the Piel forms not only of
מלט but of פלט (see below on the renderings of other instances of these
roots). 
It is a late Latin word, derived from the classical adjective <i>salvus</i>,
‘safe, sound’ and it is used in preference to the older <i>servo</i> (which
seems to mean ‘keep’ in the Vulgate).[^13] Perhaps it conveys a stronger
sense of the normal state of well-being to which a person or group is
being restored.

[^13]: <i>salvo</i> and cognates are used over twice as often overall as <i>servo</i> etc.


<i>auxilium/adiutorium</i> are used for the nouns from the root עזר, and the
related verbs were often used for the verb, alongside a number of
nominal renderings. They are sometimes found for הושׁיע too.  
Lewis & Short, <i>LD</i> (p. 38) say that <i>adiuvo</i> is the general word, while <i>auxilior</i> is
aid for the weak.

<i>eruo</i> is one of two common equivalents for הציל, but it seems not to be
widely used otherwise (occasionally for פדה). 
This verb, unlike ῥύομαι in Greek (and more like ἐξαιρέω), frequently
has a neutral or even negative sense (like other compounds of <i>ruo</i>),
but the positive use is also well attested: ‘rescue, release’. Still its
breadth of meaning may have discouraged its wider use as a rendering of
words in the lexical group.

<i>libero</i> is also commonly used for הציל (especially the Niphal) and it
appears occasionally for פדה and quite often for הושׁיע, though not as
often as <i>salvo</i>. The neutral or negative senses of הציל are represented
by various other words which mean ‘remove’ or ‘plunder’. 
<i>libero</i>, from its association with <i>liber</i>, ‘free’, etc. has the
primary sense of ‘free, release from slavery’, but it was also used much
more widely of release from e.g. an obligation or a difficulty. It
emphasises the cessation of trouble in the verbs it is used to
translate.

Words for ‘escape’ or ‘flee’ like <i>(ef)fugio</i> and <i>evado</i> are common as
renderings of the Niphal of מלט and nouns derived from פלט.

<i>redimo</i> is the most common equivalent for both גאל and פדה, but they
are distinguished by the number of cases in which <i>propinquus</i> (in the
sense ‘close relative’) is used for גאל and (phrases using) <i>pretium</i>
for פדה, and not vice versa. פרק is also rendered by <i>redimo</i> in two of
the three places where a person is the object. 
<i>redimo</i> means ‘buy back’ and particularly to ‘ransom’ a slave. The
element of ‘recovery’ is, however, not always present and it could be
used more generally for either ‘purchase’ or ‘acquire’.

The Latin equivalents bring 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span>,
and <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span> close together, with the
two latter not as clearly distinguished as they are in the LXX. On the
other hand the use of words for ‘escape, flee’ for them in certain forms
makes for more of a distinction from הושׁיע in Latin.

הציל
 has a distinctive rendering in <i>eruo</i> (though it is also found for
פדה), but the use of <i>libero</i> for both it and הושׁיע serves to maintain
some commonality between these two words, despite the non-use (except in
Gen 32:31[30]) of <i>salvo</i> for הציל.

The renderings of גאל and פדה (and פרק) again reflect both their
similarity and difference.

<b>Targums</b>: סְעַד and סיע (but not עדר) are naturally used for עזר, but
interestingly they are not used for הושׁיע.  

The meaning of סְעַד according to Jastrow (<i>DTT</i>, 1009)
is normally ‘assist, help’,
but it is also used of sustenance by food or drink.

פְּרַק
is one of two words that between them provide most of the other
renderings for the lexical group in the Targums. It is almost
universally used for 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>, 
and Heb. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>,
and twice even for <span dir="rtl" lang="he">עזר</span>.
But there are two instances of נצחנא, ‘victory’, for הושׁיע, and for
גאל
 there are two instances of קרב, indicating family relationship,
while in the ‘vengeance’ passages גאל is retained as a loan-word in
Tg<sup>O</sup> and Tg<sup>J</sup> and תְּבַע, ‘seek, claim’, is used in the
Palestinian Tgs. 
The extensive use of פרק is made possible by its wide range of meaning
in Aramaic (on this see further 1. Root and Comparative Material A.2 in
our entry for פרק). In Jewish Aramaic the meanings ‘redeem’ and ‘rescue’
predominate, but ‘remove’, ‘fall apart’, ‘untie’ and ‘divide’ are also
attested. CAL gives ‘dismantle’ as a major meaning. The predominant
meanings given above, however, are probably the most relevant to the
Targumic renderings.

<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁיזֵ(י)ב</span> 
 is the other expression that is frequently used. It is the
regular equivalent for הציל (though רוק is used for the Piel and עדי for
the Hithpael, and פְּצָא frequently appears in Psalms, Job and Proverbs),
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span> and
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span>,
and it sometimes appears for
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>.
The meaning of 
שֵׁיזֵ(י)ב
is ‘release, save’ (Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1558), ‘save’ (CAL).

<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פְּלַט</span> is occasionally used for
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span> and
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span>.
In Aramaic פְּלַט has the meanings ‘discharge (from the body)’ and
‘escape’ (Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1179): CAL attributes the meanings ‘eject’ and 
‘escape’ to
two separate verbs. In either case the latter meaning will have made
פְּלַט suitable for some forms of the word-groups in question (cf. the
use of Latin <i>effugio</i>), but not for others, since it lacks an active
transitive use for ‘deliver’.

פְּצָא
 is occasionally used. It is not found in Tg<sup>O</sup>, Tg<sup>J</sup>,
Tg<sup>PsJ</sup> or apparently in the Palestinian Tgs. But it is
frequent in the Pss, Job and Proverbs, especially for הציל. This may be
connected with the frequency of ܦܨܐ/ܦܨܝ
(<i>pṣʾ</i>/<i>pṣy</i>) in the Peshitta (see below).

The concentration on two equivalents in the Targums may have tended to
blur distinctions within the lexical group. But it would be interesting
to consider why פְּרַק was preferred for some words (especially הושׁיע)
and <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שֵׁיזֵ(י)ב</span> 
for others. What was seen as the significant difference
between them? In any case the groupings are probably significant: 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span> 
linked with 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>, 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>
and Heb. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>; 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הציל</span>
with 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span>
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span>.

<b>Peshitta</b>: The distribution of equivalents is very similar to the Targums, but there are some notable differences in the words employed.

ܥܕܪ
(<i>ʿdr</i>) is generally used for עזר, instead of סְעַד and סיע. The absence
of the latter is the more surprising, as it exists in Syriac in the same
sense.  ܥܕܪ (<i>ʿdr</i>) is also very rarely used for הושׁיע.  
The meaning of  ܥܕܪ (<i>ʿdr</i>) is ‘to help, assist’.

ܦܪܩ
(<i>prq</i>) is again the main equivalent for 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>, 
and Heb. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>.
In the case of הושׁיע this extends to renderings of שׁוֹעַ and שׁוּעַ (cf.
Vg 1x, Tg 1x). There are again two instances of הושׁיע being
rendered by <i>nṣḥnʾ</i>, ‘victory’. For 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span> 
ܬܒܓ
(<i>tbʿ</i>) again occurs in the
‘vengeance’ passages, but more surprisingly also in Ruth; and there are
three instances of ܩܪܒ
(<i>qrb</i>) being used to mark the ‘family’ dimension.
ܦܪܩ
(<i>prq</i>) is also occasionally used for הציל.

 ܦܨܐ/ܦܨܝ
(<i>pṣʾ</i>/<i>pṣy</i>)[^10a] is also widely used: it is the main equivalent for הציל and the
Piel and Niphal forms of מלט and פלט (but not so prominently for the
nouns). It is also found occasionally for הושׁיע and פדה.  
The meaning of ܦܨܐ/ܦܨܝ
(<i>pṣʾ</i>/<i>pṣy</i>)
is given as ‘deliver, set free’ by 
Payne Smith (<i>CSD</i>, 454); CAL and Sokoloff (<i>SLB</i>, 1219) give ‘to save, deliver’. 
The latter’s citations
imply that it is found in Jewish Aramaic 
[JBA presumably = ‘Jewish Babylonian Aramaic’], but it is also well attested in Christian
Palestinian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic and Syriac. In the latter (to
judge at least from our Peshitta data) it has largely displaced ܫܝܙܒ
(<i>šyzb</i>).

[^10a]: Payne Smith (CSD, 454) lists the word as ܦܨܐ (<i>pṣʾ</i>), while Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 1219, and CAD list the word as <span dir="rtl" lang="–">ܦܨܝ</span> (<i>pṣy</i>).

<span dir="rtl" lang="–">ܫܝܙܒ</span> (<i>šyzb</i>) is used for noun-forms from פלט and some instances of מלט and
פדה,
but not at all apparently for הציל.  
Payne Smith (<i>CSD</i>, 304–05) cites some derivatives,
referring them to the root <i>yzb</i>, but its entry for the verb is as
ܫܘܙܒ
(<i>šwzb</i>) on p. 564. From the derivatives it looks as though it acquired a
strongly (Christian) theological meaning in Syriac. It is given the
meaning ‘save’ in CAL.

ܦܠܛ
(<i>plṭ</i>) is found occasionally for פלט and more frequently for מלט.  
In Syriac ܦܠܛ
(<i>plṭ</i>) means ‘escape, slip away’ and in the Pael both ‘save’
and ‘eject, vomit’.

Of the major variations from Targumic renderings in the Peshitta the use
of ܥܕܪ (<i>ʿdr</i>) instead of ܣܓܕ (<i>sʿd</i>) is readily explicable by dialectal
differences. 
The extensive substitution of ܦܨܐ/ܦܨܝ
(<i>pṣʾ</i>/<i>pṣy</i>) 
for ܫܘܙܒ (<i>šwzb</i>) is less easy
to understand, since the latter verb certainly existed in Syriac and was
sometimes used for members of the lexical group in the Peshitta. Is
there again a dialectal difference behind this, or is there some other
reason (perhaps a theological one) for the favouring of  ܦܨܐ/ܦܨܝ
(<i>pṣʾ</i>/<i>pṣy</i>)? In any
case the broad division of the words other than עזר into two groups is
again reflected in the Syriac renderings, whatever exactly the perceived
difference between them was. It may be noted, among less common
equivalents, how the special uses of גאל and nominal/passive forms of מלט and פלט
 are again identified in the Peshitta.

#### (ii) The Word-Groups One by One

הושׁיע. As a minor, though important, observation we may first note that
the rendering of הושׁיע by words for ‘help’ is occasionally found in LXX,
Vg and Pesh (but not apparently in the Tg). A more striking fact is the
different associations for it which appear in the versional renderings.
The use of σῴζω in LXX links it with מלט, and the use of <i>salvo</i> in Vulg
links them both with פלט. On the other hand the rendering by
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>/ܦܪܩ (<i>prq</i>)
in the Tg and Pesh makes it part of a ‘family’ which includes other
members of the lexical group:
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>.
The divergence is not
easy to understand and it deserves further exploration. It might
indicate that the assignment of a meaning to הושׁיע was a problem, and so
two different traditions of translation developed, one in the classical
languages (and we have noted how the Old Latin might have been an
important lexical link between the translators of the LXX and the
Vulgate) and one in the Aramaic dialects. What seems to unite the two
‘traditions’, if we may call them that, is that a distinction needed to
be made between standard renderings of הושׁיע and הציל. On this the
‘classical tradition’ did allow for some overlap by its use of ῥύομαι
and <i>libero</i> for הושׁיע on some occasions. But the distinction was
generally maintained.

עזר.
This word has its standard equivalent(s) in each language or
dialect, and there is little overlap between its renderings and those of
other members of the group (but see above on הושׁיע).

הציל.
First, it may be noted that the minority sense ‘remove’ is
recognised in some renderings of LXX (σκυλεύω), Vg and Tg The use
of ἐξαιρέω and <i>eruo</i> alongside ῥύομαι and <i>libero</i> might also be a
reflection of this aspect of the word’s meaning: they are less common
(though ἐξαιρέω at least does appear) as renderings of מלט and פלט,
which lack the neutral or even negative sense of ‘removal’.   
There is some recognition of an overlap with פלט in LXX’s use of ῥύομαι
for the latter (whereas מלט goes with הושׁיע). This overlap is more
strongly present in the regular renderings of
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הציל</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span>,
and also 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span>
into Aramaic (Tg generally שׁיזב, but some cases of פצי in the
Tg<sup>K</sup>; Pesh generally  ܦܨܐ/ܦܨܝ
[<i>pṣʾ</i>/<i>pṣy</i>], but also ܫܘܙܒ
[<i>šwzb</i>]).

מלט and פלט.
 LXX marks a distinction between these words (and
establishes different affinities respectively with הציל and הושׁיע) by
its predominant use of ῥύομαι for מלט and σῴζω for פלט. In the other
Versions no such distinction occurs, in the Vulgate through the use of
<i>salvo</i> and words for ‘escape’ for both of them (here the difference
from LXX deserves note) and in Tg and Pesh by the shared use of
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שׁיזב</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פצי</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פלט</span>.

גאל.
In all the Versions the same word, one which means or can mean
‘redeem’, is used in many cases to render both גאל and פדה (and in some
degree also for פרק). But the distinctive features of גאל are also
reflected. In LXX and Vg it is the ‘family’ dimension which is most
clear, from the use of ἀγχιστεύω and words like <i>propinquus</i> (this
dimension appears only infrequently, it seems, in Tg and Pesh). In Tg
and Pesh the reference to vengeance is marked either by the retention of
גאל
 as a loanword (in Tg<sup>O</sup> and Tg<sup>J</sup>) or by the use of 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">תבע</span>/<i>tbʿ</i>
(Palestinian Tgs and Pesh). 
In Pesh ܬܒܓ
(<i>tbʿ</i>) is, more surprisingly, also
used in Ruth, perhaps in the more general sense of ‘making a claim’ for
someone. The wider sense of ‘deliverance’ is also recognised in some
uses of ῥύομαι, <i>libero</i> and שׁיזב.

פדה.
See above on גאל and also on הושׁיע. The idea of payment is sometimes reinforced by <i>pretium</i> in Vg References to family
connections do not appear in the Versions’ renderings. A more general
meaning ‘deliver’ appears in the use of ῥύομαι or σῴζω, <i>libero</i> or
<i>eruo</i> and ܦܨܐ/ܦܨܝ
(<i>pṣʾ</i>/<i>pṣy</i>), but also ܫܘܙܒ
(<i>šwzb</i>).

פרק.
 In LXX and Vg words for ‘redeem’ are used where there is a
personal object, no doubt as a reflection of this sense in Aramaic;
elsewhere a variety of words for ‘removal’ are used. In Tg and Pesh the
use of <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>/ܦܪܩ (<i>prq</i>) itself occurs more widely as a result of its various
meanings, which include ‘remove’. 

#### (iii) Summary

In a number of ways the versional renderings coincide with the semantics
of the lexical group or individual members of it as these were expounded
above on the basis of other criteria. For example, the special
characteristics of גאל and פדה and the difference between them are
visible, though in differing degrees. The use of different equivalents
in different contexts for e.g. הציל and again גאל and פדה draws
attention to their different senses. The opposition (in the technical
linguistic sense) between הושׁיע and הציל is quite strongly represented,
and this could well be attributed to the divergence over the feature of
‘separation’ (i.e. use with מן) between these verbs: the preferred
equivalents in each case would support this. The special position of עזר
and its links with הושׁיע are also reflected in the Versions.

On the other hand our survey has exposed a tendency to blur the
differences between the lexemes by the use of a restricted number of
equivalents for them. This is particularly noticeable in the Tg and Pesh
where two Aramaic words predominate in each case (the Tg<sup>K</sup> 
side with Pesh for some reason in the specific vocabulary used)
and divide the group (with the exception of עזר) into two broad
divisions. The Versions’ renderings also leave the position of הושׁיע
unclear, because they point to its close association either with מלט
(and in Vg with פלט) or with
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>,
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פדה</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פרק</span>,
implying perhaps
‘rescue’ in the one case and ‘redemption’ in the other.

### 3. Concluding Summary

Our examination of the individual lexemes has shown that some, in fact
most, of them have a range of meaning that embraces more than
deliverance from a general situation of trouble or danger. They may
additionally refer to a quite specific kind of trouble or danger, like
גאל and פדה. Or they may also be used of actions that do not involve
trouble or danger at all, such as פרק and some forms of the root נצל. In
both these situations the wider use may contribute distinctive elements
of meaning to the standard uses. Such features may help to identify the
distinctive meanings or ‘oppositions’ (in the structuralist sense) of
the words in the ‘lexical field’, though they need to be combined with
other kinds of data (especially syntagmatic relations).

One method which can contribute to the clarity of such distinctions is
<i>componential analysis</i>. (I am using the method here in a less
far-reaching way that when it is applied to the analysis of the meanings
of particular lexemes individually, though the two enterprises are and
should be related.) If we go back to the broad definition of deliverance
given earlier, we can break it down into three essential components: [an
action], [a person who benefits from it] and [a situation of danger or
trouble]. Some of the verbs are strongly associated in their pattern of
use with <i>removal</i> from a situation of danger or trouble, and this is
indicated especially by the frequency with which they are followed by
the separative preposition <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מן</span>.
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הציל</span> is the most frequent member of this
sub-group, but מלט is another. In fact both מלט and פלט belong here, but
in slightly different ways: מלט tends to express (I put it like that
because there are inevitably some exceptions) removal from danger, while
פלט
 tends to mean arrival at a place of safety (Williams 2002).

Other verbs that we have treated occur less often, if at all, with מן,
and it might be argued that when they are used with מן the explanation
is syntactical rather than lexical: i.e. we are dealing with a
‘pregnant’ use of the combination in which another verb expressing the
idea of removal is implied.[^15] A clear case of this is עזר. This verb
normally lays greater emphasis on the benefit to the person concerned
(‘help’) than on removal from danger or trouble as such. And the same is
probably true of הושׁיע: this is reflected in the popularity of modern
words for ‘help’ in recent dictionaries of Hebrew (cf. 
<i>ThWAT</i> and <i>THAT</i>.).<!--[^16]--> 
It may also
explain why this verb’s associated nouns are so frequent: nouns cannot
so easily be associated with a prepositional phrase as with a pronominal
suffix which refers to the doer or the beneficiary of the action.

[^15]: Cf. GK §119ee-gg; BDB, 578a: as, e.g., in Ps 22:22 with ענה.


Other words in the group are distinguished by what they say about the
action itself. פרק appears to mean ‘violent removal’, mainly of things
rather than persons. As such it perhaps has little concern with the
person who benefits. גאל is another example of a verb focused on a
particular kind of action, although it is much debated which of the
components of its specific legal meaning also apply to its theological
use. ‘Action by a family member’ is perhaps the most generally
applicable description, though ‘restoration to a former state of
well-being’ applies to most cases too (the PNs are the most difficult
for this). The idea of ‘payment’ of a price seems not to be implied in
the theological use. פדה probably belongs here too, with an idea of
‘liberation’ being implied in the theological use, but not a payment
(again the PNs raise some difficulty for this).

Another issue that arises about this lexical field is whether some or
all of its members have an essential or predominant theological
component to their meaning. This was maintained by Sawyer for הושׁיע,
which he suggested was ‘one of a small group of “disinfected” words (cf.
BARAʾ ‘to create’), properly used only where YHWH or his appointed
leader is subject’.[^17] Similarly it has been maintained that הציל is
used ‘overwhelmingly with a divine subject’.[^18] Even within the Old
Testament corpus this plays down the significance of those places where
these verbs have a human subject. But it also fails to recognise that
the Old Testament is a very theological book, or collection of books, so
that it is not surprising that a divine subject frequently occurs with
these and many other verbs. One would like to be able to test such
claims by reference to non-theological texts. There are some such texts
in the Old Testament, namely Song of Songs and Esther. The Song appears
to contain none of the ‘deliverance’ words (which may well be due to its
subject matter), but Esther does have the only case in BHeb. 
of <span dir="rtl" lang="he">הצלה</span> (4:14)
and an occurrence of <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מלט</span> (4:13), 
neither with a divine subject. Hebrew
inscriptions provide another possible test, but the few occurrences 
(1x <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>; 
4x <span dir="rtl" lang="he">הושׁיע</span>;
cf. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">הגאל</span> on coins) 
are probably all in religious
contexts. There are, it should be noted, a large number of proper names
in inscriptions which include elements from the lexical field, but they
are probably all theophoric or abbreviations of theophoric names, so
they do not change the picture. So it is on the Old Testament evidence
that the issue has to be judged, and as noted there are sufficient
instances of the verbs being used with a human subject to show that it
is not their meaning but their usage that has a strong theological
dimension there.

[^17]: Sawyer 1972:103. He seems to have overlooked the occurrences of the Piel of ברא for ‘cut out’ in Josh 17:15; Ezek 21:24; 23:46-47.
[^18]: R.L. Hubbard, <i>NIDOTTE</i>, 3:141-47.




It has not been part of the Cambridge centre’s working method to explore
the use of lexemes in different ‘functional languages’ of ancient
Hebrew,[^19] although we do from time to time refer, for example, to the
usage in legal texts. An issue of particular interest is whether some of
the lexemes considered are restricted to, or predominantly used in,
prose or poetry.[^20] In a broad perspective it can be said that all the
word-groups (roots) are well represented in both prose and poetry, with
a slightly larger number of occurrences in poetry which may well be due
to the frequency with which the topic of deliverance is treated in the
Psalms and in prophecy. But there are some noteworthy differences both
within and between word-groups.[^21] הושׁיע and related nouns are
significantly more frequent in poetry than in prose. For the verb the
ratio of poetic to prose occurrences is about 2:1 (higher in the
Niphal), and apart from תשׁועה (14x prose, 21x poetry) the related nouns
occur almost exclusively in poetry: even ישׁועה occurs only five times
(out of 78) in prose. For הציל the distribution is more even (93/216 in
prose; also the one occurrence of a related noun), but this is partly
due to the concentration of the Piel and Hithpael, which have
non-deliverance meanings, in prose. There is an even more striking
contrast between the verbs מלט and פלט, with the latter being entirely
poetic and the former slightly more common (50/94) in prose. It is,
however, mainly the Niphal of מלט that accounts for the prose
occurrences, while nouns related to פלט are also more common in prose
(approximately twice as frequent as in poetry). גאל and (to a lesser
extent) פדה and related nouns are more frequent in prose, but the
imbalance is largely accounted for by occurrences in legal texts (and
for גאל the special case of the book of Ruth): neither is at all common
in narrative prose. The few occurrences of פרק and related nouns are
evenly distributed between prose and poetry, but all the ‘deliverance’
cases are in poetry, suggesting (as far as the limited evidence goes)
that this semantic development is a feature of poetic style.

[^19]: As has been very productively done in SAHD entries and other publications prepared in Florence: see on this Zatelli 1995:55-64; also Zanella 2010:20-34, 389-413.
[^20]: The debates about how prose and poetry are to be distinguished and whether there is a sharp dividing-line between them will be left on one side here.
[^21]: The figures given are approximate and take only partial account of the fact that some biblical books contain both prose and poetry.



Finally, it has been our hope to draw some conclusions about <i>diachronic
aspects</i> of the semantics of this lexical field, but so far we have had
more success in calling in question some well known assertions than in
identifying positive indications of change through time. Epigraphic
evidence of proper names confirms that non-legal uses of גאל and פדה
were already established in pre-exilic times, and also that the verb
פלט, which is sometimes claimed to be ‘late’ in BHeb., was well known in
the monarchy period. One aspect of the data which we are collecting and
analysing which may take us further is the evidence from Qumran. This is
of course of interest in its own right, and the progress of dictionary
projects focused on this material will be of help to many others as well
as to ourselves. But, as Avi Hurvitz pointed out, Qumran usage is a
valuable clue for the detection of linguistic change within the Old
Testament itself, particularly in the recognition of features of ‘Late
Biblical Hebrew’. Further work on our data may also identify changes in
the meanings and uses of words for deliverance. To refer to ‘further
work’ is a reminder of the purpose of all our work in the SAHD project:
it is first and foremost to assemble the data and make them conveniently
available, not to find answers to all the questions that we or others
might have. It is a tool for further research, which can be modified in
the light of it, not the last word on the semantics of ancient Hebrew.
