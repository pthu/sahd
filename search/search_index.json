In the summer of 2005 Mrs (now Dr) Alison Gray added two further sets of entries on the basis of her MPhil thesis (Cambridge, 2004). At a later stage (from 2012) Dr Gray made valuable contributions to the completion of the three large entries for the \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 group, and Dr Kim Phillips and Mr William Ross used their linguistic and technical expertise to convert Hebrew, Greek and transliterated text in the old entries into Unicode. </p> <p>The Centre is most grateful to the Leverhulme Trust, the Jerusalem Trust, the British Academy, the Hort Fund of the Cambridge Faculty of Divinity and the Cambridge Humanities Research Grants Scheme for the grants which made this work possible. We are also very grateful to colleagues on the SAHD Executive Committee, especially Professor H.G.M. Williamson, for their careful reviews of the drafts of these entries which were submitted to them and for many helpful suggestions that they made for improvement. Whatever gaps, errors and inconsistencies may remain are our responsibility and not theirs. Other work of the centre has been published in Muraoka 1998; Aitken 2007; and on the project\u2019s websites.1</p> <p>Entries have been completed for the verbs \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc,  \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc,  \u05de\u05dc\u05d8,  \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8,  \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4,  \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8,  and  \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7     in all conjugations, together with nouns from the same roots. Originally (following John F.A. Sawyer) we called the group of lexemes that we are studying \u2018words for salvation\u2019. But \u2018salvation\u2019 has too many connotations of the inner, spiritual life to be suitable as a term for the linguistic description of classical Hebrew words which most often relate to the external circumstances of the individual or the people (German \u2018Heil\u2019 is not so problematic, perhaps). The word \u2018deliverance\u2019 is therefore now used instead, and it may be defined as \u2018an action (normally performed by a different person) for the benefit of persons who are in danger or trouble\u2019.  </p> <p>It is important to say that we are dealing with words that have such a  meaning. There are other words which can refer to actions  of such a kind, although their meaning is somewhat different: for example, \u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0, \u2018bring out\u2019, or \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4, \u2018bring up\u2019, with reference to the Exodus,  \ufb2a\u05e4\u05d8, \u2018judge\u2019, and  \u05e8\u05e4\u05d0, \u2018heal\u2019. We do not include them. There are also various metaphors that may be used to represent deliverance, especially when the trouble is itself described metaphorically, as in Ps 18:17:</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He (Yahweh) reached down from on high, he took me;   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he drew me out of mighty waters (\u05d9\u05de\ufb2a\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd, root \u05de\ufb2a\u05d4). Cf. v. 5.</p> <p>Again we do not include these. All of them belong to what  Sawyer called the wider \u2018associative field\u2019 of words for deliverance or salvation (see below). It is fully recognised that such related words and (especially in poetry) metaphors play an important part in ancient Hebrew accounts of deliverance. We hope that our work on the \u2018plainer\u2019 and more general expressions studied here will contribute to further study of the related words and metaphors, and also that such study will provide useful confirmation or correctives for the conclusions which we have reached.2</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/overview_deliverance/#previous-work","title":"Previous work","text":"<p>An obvious starting-point is the monograph of Sawyer (1972), Semantics in Biblical Research: New Methods of Defining Hebrew Words for Salvation, together with some related articles of  his (Sawyer 1965, 1967, 1968, 1975).3 The monograph\u2019s title reflects its double aim: in Sawyer\u2019s words \u2018what started out as an analysis of several biblical terms became, as it were, a practical guide to describing the meaning of OT Hebrew\u2019 (p. 2). Here we are mainly concerned with the former, narrower task, though Sawyer\u2019s views about more general issues naturally inform his specific discussions and conclusions and will need to be referred to as well. Under the wider heading of \u2018context\u2019 Sawyer notes the need to attend to different \u2018registers\u2019 and \u2018styles\u2019 of a language and he chooses to examine in detail only occurrences of \u2018salvation-words\u2019 in texts which directly address God (the prayer \u2018register\u2019). These he subdivides between six \u2018styles\u2019, which are defined initially by their introductory verbs and in cases where there is none by similarity of form and content (pp. 17-27, with a table on p. 27). Here Sawyer is only concerned with what he will later call the \u2018lexical group\u2019 of salvation-words which are \u2018very closely related to one another (p. 30):  \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc,  \u05d7\u05dc\u05e5,  \u05de\u05dc\u05d8,  \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8,  \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8,  \u05e4\u05e6\u05d4,  and  \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7  and the Biblical Hebrew nouns etymologically related to them. </p> <p>Before examining these words in detail, however, Sawyer devotes a chapter to a much wider group of lexemes which he calls \u2018the associative field of HO\u0160IA\u02bf\u2019 (pp. 29-58), an expression derived from the ideas of F. de Saussure and J. Trier: \u2018a word\u2019s associative field includes terms related to it at all levels (for instance synonyms, opposites, terms that rhyme with it or look like it)\u2019 (p. 30). Sawyer\u2019s wider group contains some 200 items, which he classifies under 13 headings derived from the meaning or social context of each item (see the table on p. 37): many are words used in a metaphorical sense. Although this collection of lexemes is acknowledged to be based largely on intuition (pp. 33-35), its value for \u2018a general study of OT language about salvation\u2019 and its advantages over (as often elsewhere) a focus on a single word or root are properly noted. Among the words studied by us \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 have their place within this wider \u2018field\u2019, but they are not given any particular prominence.</p> <p>It is in chapters 4, 5 and 6 (pp. 60-101) that Sawyer turns his attention to the narrower lexical group. Here the ideas of John Lyons\u2019s Structural Semantics (1963) and Noam Chomsky\u2019s transformational grammar (in the treatment of nouns: see pp. 62-67) are more influential. The approaches of the three chapters are clearly distinguished by their titles: \u2018Synchronic Description\u2019, \u2018Historical Description\u2019 and \u2018Definition\u2019. It is noted that \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and its related nouns (the latter actually outnumbering forms of the verb) are by far the most frequent members of the group in the \u2018prayer register\u2019, and the only ones to appear in prophetic examples of it. They have a wider associative field (including metaphors: pp. 54, 68-69) than, for example, \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc, which in this register also has no nominalisations. On the other hand Sawyer claims that \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 is less frequently transitive compared with other verbs in the group (this might be disputed) and the rarity of a following \u05de\u05df (only 4 times out of 38 in the register) makes the element of separation less prominent in its uses than elsewhere (cf. the table on p. 73). </p> <p>As for paradigmatic relations, Sawyer concentrates on reference (i.e. the extra-lingual feature referred to, as indicated by the wider context: p. 77) and opposition. Most of the evidence for the former is in fact drawn from the words\u2019 syntagmatic relations (subject, object etc.). In the prayer register the subject of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 is always Yahweh except in Hos 14:4, and this is generally the case with \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc (the exception is Isa 44:17 where an idol/foreign god is so addressed). Of course such a limitation could well be due to the choice of register. \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 is used with a human \u2018subject\u2019 in Judg 5:23, which is taken to indicate its \u2018more general application\u2019 \u2013 a conclusion which is indeed borne out by its usage elsewhere (p. 81), but scarcely by the limited evidence in the register taken alone. The object is always the speaker or his community (again this is not surprising in the register), and where specified is sometimes its leadership (though only with \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, as it happens). The danger \u2018from\u2019 which someone is removed is generally the speaker\u2019s enemies (once \u05d7\u05de\u05e1 as a [superficially] generic term) with all the words examined. Among other meaning-relations opposition (the favourite of structural linguists) is generally the most illuminating, and Sawyer\u2019s examples produce the following oppositions:  for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 there  are  \u05d4\u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc, \u05de\u05d5\u05ea,  \u05e0\u05e4\u05dc  (sc. into the hands of enemies), \u05e7\u05e6\u05e8 (probably), \u05e0\u05d3\u05d4\u05dd, and \u05e9\u05e7\u05e8; for the other words there is only (for \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8) \u05db\u05d7\u05e9.  As Sawyer points out, these words connect with specific aspects (\u2018components\u2019?) of the meaning of the words in the group, some relating to the subject and some to the treatment of the object: between them they narrow down (but do not completely determine) the meaning. Further help is provided by consequences (blessing, praise, security), implication (by way  of a \u05db\u05d9\u2013clause) and poetic parallelism,  the last indicating a relation to \u05e2\u05e0\u05d4, \u05e9\u05de\u05e2, and  \u05e8\u05e4\u05d0,  which suggests \u2018readiness to intervene\u2019 and \u2018general health, physical and spiritual\u2019 as central aspects of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 in contrast to the ideas of separation or removal which characterise the other members of the group. These are at any rate helpful leads, even if only to part of the definition desired.</p> <p>The \u2018historical description\u2019 in chapter 5 includes some reference to wider etymological relations outside Biblical Hebrew, and so represents a partial departure from the position of James Barr on this issue (see Barr 1961: 107-160; and e.g. Barr 2014a; 2014b.). But this does not extend to an acceptance of the long-popular but now generally discarded association of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 with Arabic wasi\u02bfa, \u2018be wide, spacious\u2019: Sawyer accepts the evidence from Ugaritic and Epigraphic South Arabian that the second consonant of the root was originally t and not s (Sawyer 1972, 93-94;  cf. also Sawyer 1975). Unfortunately the extra-biblical occurrences of the root are so far all in proper names, so they add nothing significant to our understanding of its meaning(s). From an examination of its usage within and beyond the prayer register Sawyer concludes that \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 (i) \u2018is applied almost exclusively to divine intervention or the activity of divinely appointed agents such as kings and judges\u2019 (p. 94) and (ii) often has a \u2018forensic\u2019 meaning, though not necessarily a forensic origin (p. 95). These features are also evident in post-biblical Hebrew. \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc and \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 (for which \u05e2\u05d3\u05e8 occasionally occurs as a loan from Aramaic), on the other hand, have no special religious connotations, and this continues to be the case in later phases of Hebrew. The notion of separation appears with both verbs, much more frequently with the former. Sawyer treats \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 (which occurs only in Hebrew) as a by-form of the more widely attested \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 and notes its occurrence in the passive (Niphal) and the rarity of a divine subject with it, which fits in with its rarity in the Psalms. In later Hebrew it becomes the preferred form for \u2018rescue, escape\u2019. Finally, three rarer words are discussed,  \u05d7\u05dc\u05e5, \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7, and  \u05e4\u05e6\u05d4, the latter two being seen, in the meaning \u2018save\u2019, as loans from Aramaic.</p> <p>The final chapter on the lexical group (ch. 6, \u2018Definition\u2019) helpfully identifies the oppositions between different terms as regards frequency, nominalisation, transitivity, separation and religious context, and presents this information in three different ways, including a series of block diagrams (p. 111). The conclusions vary slightly, but according to Sawyer not significantly, depending on whether occurrences in the register alone (pp. 103-05) or throughout the OT (pp. 105-11) are being considered.</p> <p>Detailed comments on some of Sawyer\u2019s conclusions will follow in the summary of our own results later on. A few general points may be made here. Sawyer\u2019s attention to \u2018register\u2019 is important, and similar to the concept of \u2018functional languages\u2019 used by the Florence centre of SAHD. But the examination of only one register in detail, however understandable for the doctoral dissertation on which Sawyer\u2019s book was based, becomes a serious handicap when the meanings of words that occur frequently elsewhere have to be determined. (It is perhaps less of a problem for the development of an appropriate method for the semantic study of Biblical Hebrew, which is Sawyer\u2019s other aim.) Sawyer is aware of this and, as noted, some of his discussion takes account of occurrences outside the prayer register. But without more detailed study it is not clear whether one can have confidence that (some of) his conclusions do in fact apply to the Biblical Hebrew corpus as a whole, or indeed even to the prayer register itself, since the data there are sometimes very limited in extent. Further, the inclusion of information about meanings in rabbinic, medieval and modern Hebrew is interesting and may sometimes confirm or suggest trends in the development of meanings, but it is curious that virtually no attention is paid to ancient Hebrew inscriptions, the Hebrew text of Ben Sira and the Dead Sea Scrolls, which arguably are much more relevant for the study of Biblical Hebrew.4</p> <p>A wider range of occurrences of the words in question is reviewed in the major theological dictionaries of the OT that have appeared since 1970 (THAT/ TLOT; ThWAT/ TDOT, NICOTTE).5  Their articles on the words studied here will be briefly surveyed, with special reference to controversial issues, before an overview of the SAHD entries themselves is given.</p> <p>1. \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2.  There is widespread support for the idea that \u2018help\u2019 is the primary or basic meaning, though NIDOTTE continues to use the traditional equivalent \u2018salvation\u2019 to excess and is too focussed on theological uses (even for a theological dictionary!). THAT (Stolz 1978) is the best on the references to human \u2018help\u2019, and also highlights the cultic and eschatological uses well, in addition to a possible Heimat (for the religious use?) in Holy War traditions. Sawyer (1982) in  ThWAT reaffirms his emphasis on forensic usage (as in his book), but now seems to see it as dependent upon the general theological uses of the word.</p> <p>2. \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc. The core meaning is seen as \u2018take away\u2019, though THAT (Bergmann 1978)  qualifies this to mean \u2018from a place\u2019 rather than \u2018out of\u2019. This may be behind NIDOTTE\u2019s point that the action may be preventative as well as a rescue from an actual situation of trouble. NIDOTTE derives a nuance of \u2018snatching away\u2019 from the conjugations other than the Hiphil. Contrasts with \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 are noted in ThWAT (Hossfeld and Kalthoff 1986) and THAT, and also with \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 in the latter. Emphasis is laid on the use with a divine subject, but the statistics in THAT show that this applies to little more than half the occurrences.</p> <p>3. \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8. The idea of \u2018help\u2019 is explicated by ThWAT (Lipi\u0144ski and Fabry 1989) as involving cooperation of both parties, in a distinction from other words in the group, and as possibly involving an enduring state, as in alliances (deduced from the nouns?). The idea of \u2018protection\u2019 is sometimes prominent according to THAT (Bergmann 1978b) and NIDOTTE.  Both ThWAT and NIDOTTE  pick up the frequent occurrences in Chronicles, to the virtual exclusion of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc  - one wonders why this might be.  \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8  continues to be common in Deutero-Isaiah and the Psalms as a way of multiplying synonyms.</p> <p>4. \u05d7\u05dc\u05e5. NIDOTTE sees \u2018removal\u2019 as the central idea, but makes little attempt to correlate the individual senses with this. ThWAT gives a very fragmented account of the word, but does note that it rarely has any direct reference to affliction or trouble (so that the emphasis is on the benefit to the person?).</p> <p>5. \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 / \u05de\u05dc\u05d8.  The general view is that \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 is a special Hebrew derivation from \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8. This conclusion sits a little awkwardly with the intra-Hebrew distribution of the words, which makes occurrences of \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 mainly \u2018late\u2019, as seen by NIDOTTE. ThWAT (Hasel 1989, 598) identifies a distinction from \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 (from Jenni),  with the latter being viewed as a subsequent action (or is it a summary word?). The distinction between \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8  (see below on Williams.) is already there in essence in all three articles, though THAT (Ruprecht 1978)  claims that there is no distinction of meaning when they are used in parallel, and NIDOTTE finds evidence of both \u2018from\u2019 and \u2018to\u2019 with \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8. For \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 it suggests \u2018slip away safely\u2019 as basic. The idea of \u2018escape\u2019 is central, but this is obscured by  LXX\u2019s use of \u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u0345\u03b6\u03c9.</p> <p>6. \u05e4\u05e6\u05d4.  Only NIDOTTE deals with it: the normal sense is \u2018open\u2019, and only Psalm 144 extends this to \u2018deliver\u2019.</p> <p>7. \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7.  The nuance of \u2018force\u2019 is well recognised in ThWAT (Reiterer 1989) and  NIDOTTE and  helps to distinguish it. There is no entry for it in THAT. NIDOTTE also sees \u2018separation\u2019 as involved in some cases (nouns in 1 Samuel 4 and Obad 14; also the Daniel 4 BAram. occurrence).</p> <p>8. \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc.  There is a notable difference between ThWAT (Ringgren 1973), which sees the general use as basic, and THAT (Stamm 1978a) and NIDOTTE, which make the legal use original. NIDOTTE has a good distinction between the technical legal uses in Leviticus and a general reference to family responsibility, as in Ruth and elsewhere. The main distinctions from \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 are the ideas of \u2018reclaiming\u2019 and the involvement of a family member (which could be connected).</p> <p>9. \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4. The same issue about development surfaces here, with both ThWAT (Cazelles 1989) and THAT (Stamm 1978b) making the legal use primary, in the latter case specifically in the case of trade; whereas NIDOTTE follows Jepsen in tracing this back to a more general usage. Despite this, curiously, NIDOTTE uses the word \u2018ransom\u2019 much too often. ThWAT makes a lot of the connection with \u05db\u05e4\u05e8 (via the nouns), but the evidence against this is well assembled in NIDOTTE.</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/overview_deliverance/#the-sahd-entries","title":"The SAHD Entries","text":"<p>The lexemes in this group which have so far been investigated by the SAHD centre in Cambridge6 correspond to the most widely attested members of Sawyer\u2019s inner \u2018lexical group\u2019, plus  \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc, \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4, and  \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7. Among the less frequent members of the inner group we have not (yet) dealt with \u05d7\u05dc\u05e5 and \u05e4\u05e6\u05d4, but we recently decided to include \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7, mainly because of the widespread use of its Aramaic cognate to render various members of the lexical group in the Targums and the Peshitta. \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 were placed by Sawyer in the wider \u2018associative\u2019 field of words for salvation, but we have included them because at least some of their uses come very close to those of the words in the inner group, as Sawyer himself acknowledges (p. 36; cf. p. 57). It is not entirely clear why he excluded them from the inner group, but he was clearly convinced by the view that their general theological use is a metaphorical development from originally legal expressions (pp. 54-55) and perhaps this was the reason. If so, the argument is weakened, for him at least, by the idea that \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 itself \u2018was originally a forensic term\u2019.7 Our own decision to include them finds some support in NIDOTTE\u2019s definition of the semantic field of \u2018salvation\u2019 (5, pp. 165-66): it also includes \ufb2b\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d3, \u2018remnant\u2019, presumably because of its relationship to nouns from the root \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 (though oddly not \ufb2a\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea), and also \ufb2a\u05b8\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd, whose semantic relationship to \u05d9\ufb2a\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 and related words certainly deserves consideration. Such a study might also make reference to Aitken\u2019s entry on \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4.</p> <p>This overview of the entries will proceed in three stages.

Specific conclusions","text":"<p>a.  \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2: We concur with the general view that the etymological derivation of its meaning from the idea of \u2018spaciousness\u2019 has been disproved. This idea does feature in one associated metaphor (Sawyer), but it makes no special contribution to the verb\u2019s meaning. There are no obvious \u2018concrete\u2019 uses from which it might be deduced (unless \u221a\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7 were a by-form and had a specific reference to \u2018wealth\u2019). In its many occurrences (202x in BHeb.) the verb expresses \u2018the bringing of assistance to someone in need, in military, civil and judicial contexts\u2019. No one of these areas has a clear priority, and Sawyer\u2019s earlier suggestion that the \u2018forensic\u2019 use is basic should be rejected. \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 can, in wisdom literature, refer to an increase in prosperity or wealth, and occasionally in the Psalms and elsewhere also to defence, i.e. protection in advance from enemy attack. Use with \u05de\u05df is comparatively low (c. 23x, 12%) and Sawyer\u2019s conclusion about its low \u2018transitivity\u2019 should be noted (and perhaps re-examined): these features suggest that the focus of the verb is on the agent or the action rather than the beneficiary or the danger/need.</p> <p>Related nouns account for another 180 or so occurrences in BHeb., the great majority being instances of three nouns: \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2, \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4, and  \u05ea\u05bc\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4. Their distribution is especially heavy in poetry (whereas the verb has over 35% of its occurrences in prose), mainly in the Psalms and Isaiah, though 11 of the 37 occurrences of \u05ea\u05bc\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 are in prose. All of them more often refer to a state of security than to an action that brings it about, and among them only \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 exhibits a plural form (12x in BHeb.; also the hapax \u05de\u05d5\u05b9\ufb2a\u05b8\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4). \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 is particularly common in descriptions of God, and it hardly ever refers to an action. \u05ea\u05bc\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 is not used at Qumran, unlike the other two nouns, but it does occur 3x in Ben Sira (and also in MHeb.). It is commonly derived from \u221a\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7, but without good reason: its meaning seems to be indistinguishable from \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4. The other two nouns (possibly) derived from \u221a\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7  (otherwise it occurs only in PNs) seem to mean \u2018great man\u2019 (\ufb2a\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b7: at least in the two clear cases) and \u2018cry for help\u2019 (\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7: this is probably derived from \ufb2a\u05b8\u05d5\u05b7\u05e2, like \ufb2a\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b7 in Isa 22:5) and provide no basis for a connection between the two roots.</p> <p>b.  \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8: This is the general Hebrew word for \u2018help\u2019, but it is only about half as common as \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and its related nouns. Its generality and wide range of contexts of use mean that it could be regarded as the \u2018superordinate\u2019 expression to which other words in the group relate as hyponyms. On the other hand, it has some distinctive characteristics \u2013 the perhaps surprising frequency of verbs of motion with the noun \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d4 and the infrequency of constructions with \u05de\u05df (though it may be more surprising that there are any at all).</p> <p>c.  \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc: This root is represented almost entirely by verbal forms, in no less than five conjugations. The noun \u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d4 occurs only once in BHeb., in Esther (LBHeb.), but it became common in MHeb. By far the most common conjugation is the Hiphil (219x), in which the meaning is most often the deliverance of people from danger to safety. Rarer uses refer to the removal and occasionally the recovery (compare here \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and also \ufb2a\u05d5\u05d1 Hiph.) of objects from one place to another. Association with \u05de\u05df is very frequent. The Niphal provides the passive of the main sense, whereas the Hophal (3x) is the passive of \u2018removal\u2019. The Piel (4x) and Hithpael (1x) also generally represent this sense. From these data one could reasonably deduce a basic sense of \u2018remove\u2019, whose prime specialisation (which became the dominant use) was for \u2018deliverance from danger\u2019, with a much rarer specialisation to \u2018recovery\u2019.</p> <p>d.  \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 : Our entry on \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 (by Williams)  points out that it is the Piel forms of the verb (34x) and the related nouns (c. 60x) which account for the great majority of the occurrences. The Qal, Niphal (only at Qumran) and Hiphil are all rare. Williams argues that, as partly observed in earlier studies, the meaning is overwhelmingly \u2018bring to safety\u2019 (so that LXX \u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u0345\u03b6\u03c9 is a very appropriate equivalent;  Williams 2002).  He observes that the process of rescue from danger or trouble is reflected in what may be imagined as a semantic \u2018line\u2019, with the idea of escape from hostile forces at one end and arrival at a place of safety at the other. \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 corresponds predominantly to the latter, while \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 occupies the opposite end of the line, i.e. the sense \u2018escape\u2019 (in the Niphal) or \u2018rescue\u2019. The argument is supported by observations about the frequency of nominal forms and PNs (indicating a settled state) from the root \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 in contrast to their rarity with \u05de\u05dc\u05d8, by the striking difference in the proportions of occurrences associated with \u05de\u05df (69% with \u05de\u05dc\u05d8, but only 12% with \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8: noted already by Sawyer 1972, 108) and syntagmatic relations with words such as \u05e0\u05d5\u05e1 and \u05d1\u05e8\u05d7. These observations undermine the common view that the verbs \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 are \u2018complementary\u2019 but essentially synonymous, with \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 supplying the passive forms and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 the nominalisation. The fact that both verbs occur, in almost equal numbers, in the Piel should have already suggested that this was not the whole story. The entry on \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 (by Aitken) notes that its Niphal is over twice as frequent as its Piel (72x vs. 35x), while the Hiphil and Hithpael are both rare. The use of the Hiphil for childbirth and the Hithpael for emission or escape could seem to support Williams\u2019s argument. But with the Niphal (which is unattested for \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 in BHeb.) directional morphemes as well as constructions with \u05de\u05df are found, suggesting that in this passive conjugation there is more of an overlap between the meanings of the two verbs. Williams\u2019s full account makes some allowance for this in a different way by recognising some \u2018moments\u2019 on the semantic \u2018line\u2019 to which both verbs could refer, even though the predominant focus in each case is on the opposite ends of it. Aitken has identified a structural reason for one such overlap.</p> <p>e.  \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc: There has been much debate about the semantics of this word (see above). Our entry (by Alison Gray) concludes that the basic meaning is \u2018to act as a kinsman\u2019 [we should add \u2018for the benefit of another\u2019 here] (hence the nominalised use of the participle \u05d2\u05bc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc), from which there developed the specialised legal senses of \u2018buy or claim back, redeem\u2019 (which generated the cultic use for \u2018buy back [not as a kinsman] from God\u2019) and then \u2018avenge\u2019 (bloodshed: hence the expression \u05d2\u05bc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05be\u05d4\u05b7\u05d3\u05bc\u05b8\u05dd). The theological uses (which include that of the nominalised participle \u05d2\u05bc\u05b9\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc) derive not from these legal and cultic senses but from the original more general meaning and attracted in some cases the construction with \u05de\u05df from verbs with a related meaning. This development can be clarified by distinguishing [kin], [buy] and [claim back] as the semantic components of the verb. The noun \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 relates only to the cultic and legal meanings in BHeb., but its use is widened at Qumran and in other post-biblical occurrences to include a theological reference. The one occurrence of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd probably has (legal) redemption in view, though \u2018vengeance\u2019 is also a possibility.</p> <p>f.  \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4: Again there has been much debate about this group of words. Our entry (also by Gray) concludes that the general meaning \u2018liberate\u2019 is basic (with Jepsen and against Stamm, who sees the theological usage as dependent upon and affected by the legal uses). In legal texts it means release as the result of a ransom payment or the death of an animal (or, at Qumran, an oath). In theological uses it can express deliverance from enemies (like \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and including, in Deuteronomy, at the Exodus) and occasionally from sin and the construction with \u05de\u05df is sometimes found. But there is no allusion there to an associated payment or death. Among the nouns \u05e4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea is confined to theological contexts (it is very common at Qumran) and represents the act of deliverance. The other two nouns, \u05e4\u05d3\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05df, both stand for the ransom price that is paid and indicate how central this is to the legal uses of the verb. \u05e4\u05d3\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd is used in cultic contexts, but \u05e4\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05df is not. As a cultic term \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 is indistinguishable from and interchangeable with the weakened sense of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and is also used of \u2018buying back\u2019 an animal or person from God, but elsewhere the kin-relatedness of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc makes the meanings of the two verbs clearly distinct.</p> <p>g.  \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7: Only three occurrences of this verb and its related nouns (plus one in BAram.) belong to the semantic field of salvation/deliverance. In the majority of its uses it refers to the violent removal of an object, or part of an object, not a person: so \u2018tear off\u2019. The noun \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e7,  \u2018plunder\u2019, is clearly related to this meaning. Other nouns refer to bones or joints, probably as \u2018broken\u2019 parts of the body of a human or an animal. Where the verb is used with a personal object, the idea of violent removal could still be present, although this is generally not recognised in modern translations. In Aramaic the verb is much more widely used with a personal object in senses such as \u2018save, redeem\u2019 (hence its popularity as a rendering of other words in the lexical group), and another possibility is that the Hebrew occurrences referred to above, three of which are certainly exilic or later, reflect the influence of the Aramaic verb.</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/overview_deliverance/#2-the-renderings-in-the-ancient-versions","title":"2. The renderings in the Ancient Versions","text":"<p>An important element of our work is the extensive analysis of the renderings given to these words in the ancient Versions. This could provide something akin to the \u2018testimony of the native speaker\u2019 which is regarded by linguists as invaluable in the study of semantics and especially for distinguishing the nuances of closely related terms. Of course the native speakers concerned would be those who lived some time after the texts in question were composed (in most cases at least), but the fact that in their translations they were usually trying to represent what the words meant in the older biblical texts might in theory preserve a true memory of how they had been understood in earlier times.</p> <p>Only the broad tendencies of the translators will be summarised here, even though detailed examination of individual instances (and rarer renderings) might well shed valuable light on the distinctions of meaning that need to be made.

The rendering of the former pair by \u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u0345\u03b6\u03c9 (and less often by \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) reflects their strong expression of benefit to the object of the action and also attributes to them an element of rescue or escape. It is possible that the occasional use of \u03b2\u03bf\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u0301\u03c9 for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 (but not \u05de\u05dc\u05d8) gives some recognition to its stronger focus on benefit than danger.</p> <p>The choice of \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 lends to them both its positive sense of \u2018set free\u2019. \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u0301\u03c9 is also used frequently for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc and less often for \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, and its own possession of a positive sense fits in with this. Possibly its neutral and negative senses are responsible for its frequency with \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc, since the latter also has such senses in a minority of cases. In other words the LXX may indicate an awareness of \u2018remove\u2019 as well as \u2018rescue\u2019 in the meanings of \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc.</p> <p>Finally the use of \u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u0301\u03c9/\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 for \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 reflects the place of a payment in many instances of these verbs, though the use of other verbs recognises that this is not universal and the examples of \u1f00\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u0301\u03c9 for \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc help to identify a linguistic component that distinguishes these two verbs.</p> <p>[Our data on the Jewish revisers (Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus)  are unfortunately still patchy (with none at all on \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc; but for the latter they tend towards \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 rather than \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u0301\u03c9).9 The distinction between \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 by the use of \u1f00\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u0301\u03c9 for the former is more frequent in them. For \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 Aquila has \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u0345\u03b6\u03c9 regularly, while Symmachus prefers \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 or compounds of \u03c6\u03b5\u03c5\u0301\u03b3\u03c9, none of which appears for \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 in the meagre data that we have for it.]</p> <p>Vulgate: The pattern of renderings is very similar to the LXX, quite likely through the mediation of the Old Latin. But there are one or two notable differences.</p> <p>salvo is regularly used for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and for the Piel forms not only of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 but of \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 (see below on the renderings of other instances of these roots).  It is a late Latin word, derived from the classical adjective salvus, \u2018safe, sound\u2019, and it is used in preference to the older servo (which seems to mean \u2018keep\u2019 in the Vulgate).10 Perhaps it conveys a stronger sense of the normal state of well-being to which a person or group is being restored.</p> <p>auxilium/adiutorium are used for the nouns from the root \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8, and the related verbs were often used for the verb, alongside a number of nominal renderings. They are sometimes found for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 too.  Lewis &amp; Short, LD (p. 38) say that adiuvo is the general word, while auxilior is aid for the weak.</p> <p>eruo is one of two common equivalents for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc, but it seems not to be widely used otherwise (occasionally for \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4).  This verb, unlike \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 in Greek (and more like \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u0301\u03c9), frequently has a neutral or even negative sense (like other compounds of ruo), but the positive use is also well attested: \u2018rescue, release\u2019. Still its breadth of meaning may have discouraged its wider use as a rendering of words in the lexical group.</p> <p>libero is also commonly used for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc (especially the Niphal) and it appears occasionally for \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 and quite often for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, though not as often as salvo. The neutral or negative senses of \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc are represented by various other words which mean \u2018remove\u2019 or \u2018plunder\u2019.  libero, from its association with liber, \u2018free\u2019, etc. has the primary sense of \u2018free, release from slavery\u2019, but it was also used much more widely of release from e.g. an obligation or a difficulty. It emphasises the cessation of trouble in the verbs it is used to translate.</p> <p>Words for \u2018escape\u2019 or \u2018flee\u2019 like (ef)fugio and evado are common as renderings of the Niphal of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and nouns derived from \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8.</p> <p>redimo is the most common equivalent for both \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4, but they are distinguished by the number of cases in which propinquus (in the sense \u2018close relative\u2019) is used for \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and (phrases using) pretium for \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4, and not vice versa. \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7 is also rendered by redimo in two of the three places where a person is the object.  redimo means \u2018buy back\u2019 and particularly to \u2018ransom\u2019 a slave. The element of \u2018recovery\u2019 is, however, not always present and it could be used more generally for either \u2018purchase\u2019 or \u2018acquire\u2019.</p> <p>The Latin equivalents bring  \u05de\u05dc\u05d8, \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 close together, with the two latter not as clearly distinguished as they are in the LXX. On the other hand the use of words for \u2018escape, flee\u2019 for them in certain forms makes for more of a distinction from \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 in Latin.</p> <p>\u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc  has a distinctive rendering in eruo (though it is also found for \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4), but the use of libero for both it and \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 serves to maintain some commonality between these two words, despite the non-use (except in Gen 32:31[30]) of salvo for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc.</p> <p>The renderings of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 (and \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7) again reflect both their similarity and difference.</p> <p>Targums:  \u05e1\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3 and \u05e1\u05d9\u05e2 (but not \u05e2\u05d3\u05e8) are naturally used for \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8, but interestingly they are not used for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2. The meaning of \u05e1\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3 according to Jastrow (DTT, 1009) is normally \u2018assist, help\u2019, but it is also used of sustenance by food or drink.</p> <p>\u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05e7 is one of two words that between them provide most of the other renderings for the lexical group in the Targums. It is almost universally used for  \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc, \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4,  and Heb. \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7, and twice even for \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8. But there are two instances of \u05e0\u05e6\u05d7\u05e0\u05d0, \u2018victory\u2019, for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, and for \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc  there are two instances of \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1, indicating family relationship, while in the \u2018vengeance\u2019 passages \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc is retained as a loan-word in TgO and TgJ and \u05ea\u05bc\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2, \u2018seek, claim\u2019, is used in the Palestinian Tgs.  The extensive use of \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7 is made possible by its wide range of meaning in Aramaic (on this see further 1. Root and Comparative Material A.2 in our entry for \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7). In Jewish Aramaic the meanings \u2018redeem\u2019 and \u2018rescue\u2019 predominate, but \u2018remove\u2019, \u2018fall apart\u2019, \u2018untie\u2019 and \u2018divide\u2019 are also attested. CAL gives \u2018dismantle\u2019 as a major meaning. The predominant meanings given above, however, are probably the most relevant to the Targumic renderings.</p> <p>\ufb2a\u05b5\u05d9\u05d6\u05b5(\u05d9)\u05d1   is the other expression that is frequently used. It is the regular equivalent for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc (though \u05e8\u05d5\u05e7 is used for the Piel and \u05e2\u05d3\u05d9 for the Hithpael, and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05e6\u05b8\u05d0 frequently appears in Psalms, Job and Proverbs), \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, and it sometimes appears for \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc. The meaning of \ufb2a\u05b5\u05d9\u05d6\u05b5(\u05d9)\u05d1 is \u2018release, save\u2019 (Jastrow, DTT, 1558), \u2018save\u2019 (CAL).</p> <p>\u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05d8  is occasionally used for \u05de\u05dc\u05d8  and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8.  In Aramaic \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05d8 has the meanings \u2018discharge (from the body)\u2019 and \u2018escape\u2019 (Jastrow, DTT, 1179): CAL attributes the meanings \u2018eject\u2019 and  \u2018escape\u2019 to two separate verbs. In either case the latter meaning will have made \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b7\u05d8 suitable for some forms of the word-groups in question (cf. the use of Latin effugio), but not for others, since it lacks an active transitive use for \u2018deliver\u2019.</p> <p>\u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05e6\u05b8\u05d0  is occasionally used. It is not found in TgO, TgJ, TgPsJ or apparently in the Palestinian Tgs. But it is frequent in the Pss, Job and Proverbs, especially for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc. This may be connected with the frequency of p\u1e63\u02be\u2009 in the Peshitta (see below).</p> <p>The concentration on two equivalents in the Targums may have tended to blur distinctions within the lexical group. But it would be interesting to consider why \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05e7 was preferred for some words (especially \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2) and \ufb2a\u05b5\u05d9\u05d6\u05b5(\u05d9)\u05d1  for others. What was seen as the significant difference between them? In any case the groupings are probably significant:  \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2  linked with  \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc,  \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 and Heb. \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7;  \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc with  \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and  \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8.</p> <p>Peshitta: The distribution of equivalents is very similar to the Targums, but there are some notable differences in the words employed.</p> <p>\u0725\u0715\u072a (\u02bfdr) is generally used for \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8, instead of \u05e1\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3 and \u05e1\u05d9\u05e2. The absence of the latter is the more surprising, as it exists in Syriac in the same sense. \u0725\u0715\u072a  (\u02bfdr) is also very rarely used for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2.  The meaning of \u0725\u0715\u072a (\u02bfdr) is \u2018help, assist\u2019.</p> <p>\u0726\u072a\u0729 (prq) is again the main equivalent for  \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc, \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4,  and Heb. \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7. In the case of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 this extends to renderings of \ufb2a\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b7 and \ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7 (cf. Vg 1x, Tg 1x). There are again two instances of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 being rendered by \u0722\u0728\u071a\u0722\u0710 (ne\u1e63\u1e25\u0101n\u0101), \u2018victory\u2019.  For \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc \u072c\u0712\u0725  (tb\u02bf\u2009) again occurs in the \u2018vengeance\u2019 passages, but more surprisingly also in Ruth; and there are three instances of \u0729\u072a\u0712 (qrb) being used to mark the \u2018family\u2019 dimension. \u0726\u072a\u0729 (prq) is also occasionally used for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc.</p> <p>\u0726\u0728\u0710 (p\u1e63\u02be\u2009) is also widely used: it is the main equivalent for \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc and the Piel and Niphal forms of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 (but not so prominently for the nouns). It is also found occasionally for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4.  The meaning of \u0726\u0728\u0710 (p\u1e63\u02be\u2009) is given as \u2018deliver, set free\u2019 by  Payne Smith (CSD, 454); CAL (under p\u1e63y) gives \u2018save\u2019.  The latter\u2019s citations imply that it is found in Jewish Aramaic [JBA presumably = \u2018Jewish Babylonian Aramaic\u2019], but it is also well attested in Christian Palestinian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic and Syriac. In the latter (to judge at least from our Peshitta data) it has largely displaced  \u072b\u071d\u0719\u0712 (\u0161yzb).</p> <p>\u072b\u071d\u0719\u0712 (\u0161yzb) is used for noun-forms from  \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 and some instances of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and  \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4, but not at all apparently for  \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc.  Payne Smith (CSD, 304\u201305) cites some derivatives, referring them to the root  \u071d\u0719\u0712 (yzb), but its entry for the verb is as \u072b\u0718\u0719\u0712 (\u0161wzb; CSD, 564). From the derivatives it looks as though it acquired a strongly (Christian) theological meaning in Syriac. It is given the meaning \u2018save\u2019 in CAL.</p> <p>\u0726\u0720\u071b (pl\u1e6d) is found occasionally for \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 and more frequently for \u05de\u05dc\u05d8.  In Syriac \u0726\u0720\u071b (pl\u1e6d) means \u2018escape, slip away\u2019 and in the Pael both \u2018save\u2019 and \u2018eject, vomit\u2019.</p> <p>Of the major variations from Targumic renderings in the Peshitta the use of  \u0725\u0715\u072a (\u02bfdr) instead of  \u0723\u0725\u0715 (s\u02bfd) is readily explicable by dialectal differences. The extensive substitution of  \u0726\u0728\u0710 (p\u1e63\u02be\u2009) for  \u072b\u071d\u0719\u0712 (\u0161yzb) is less easy to understand, since the latter verb certainly existed in Syriac and was sometimes used for members of the lexical group in the Peshitta. Is there again a dialectal difference behind this, or is there some other reason (perhaps a theological one) for the favouring of  \u0726\u0728\u0710 (p\u1e63\u02be\u2009)? In any  case the broad division of the words other than \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 into two groups is again reflected in the Syriac renderings, whatever exactly the perceived difference between them was. It may be noted, among less common equivalents, how the special uses of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and nominal/passive forms of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and  \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 are again identified in the Peshitta.</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/overview_deliverance/#ii-the-word-groups-one-by-one","title":"(ii) The Word-Groups One by One","text":"<p>\u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2. As a minor, though important, observation we may first note that the rendering of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 by words for \u2018help\u2019 is occasionally found in LXX, Vg and Pesh (but not apparently in the Tg). A more striking fact is the different associations for it which appear in the versional renderings. The use of \u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u0345\u03b6\u03c9 in LXX links it with \u05de\u05dc\u05d8, and the use of salvo in Vulg links them both with \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8. On the other hand the rendering by \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7/praq in the Tg and Pesh makes it part of a \u2018family\u2019 which includes other members of the lexical group: \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc, \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4, and  \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7. The divergence is not easy to understand and it deserves further exploration. It might indicate that the assignment of a meaning to \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 was a problem, and so two different traditions of translation developed, one in the classical languages (and we have noted how the Old Latin might have been an important lexical link between the translators of the LXX and the Vulgate) and one in the Aramaic dialects. What seems to unite the two \u2018traditions\u2019, if we may call them that, is that a distinction needed to be made between standard renderings of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc. On this the \u2018classical tradition\u2019 did allow for some overlap by its use of \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 and libero for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 on some occasions. But the distinction was generally maintained.</p> <p>\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8. This word has its standard equivalent(s) in each language or dialect, and there is little overlap between its renderings and those of other members of the group (but see above on \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2).</p> <p>\u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc. First, it may be noted that the minority sense \u2018remove\u2019 is recognised in some renderings of LXX (\u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u0301\u03c9), Vg and Tg. The use of \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u0301\u03c9 and eruo alongside \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 and libero might also be a reflection of this aspect of the word\u2019s meaning: they are less common (though \u1f10\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u0301\u03c9 at least does appear) as renderings of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, which lack the neutral or even negative sense of \u2018removal\u2019.  There is some recognition of an overlap with \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 in LXX\u2019s use of \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 for the latter (whereas \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 goes with \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2). This overlap is more strongly present in the regular renderings of \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc, \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, and also  \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 into Aramaic (Tg generally \ufb2a\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1, but some cases of \u05e4\u05e6\u05d9 in the TgK; Pesh generally  \u0726\u0728\u071d [p\u1e63y], but also  \u072b\u071d\u0719\u0712 [\u0161yzb]).</p> <p>\u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8.  LXX marks a distinction between these words (and establishes different affinities respectively with \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc and \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2) by its predominant use of \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 for \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u0345\u03b6\u03c9 for \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8. In the other Versions no such distinction occurs, in the Vulgate through the use of salvo and words for \u2018escape\u2019 for both of them (here the difference from LXX deserves note) and in Tg and Pesh by the shared use of \ufb2a\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1, \u05e4\u05e6\u05d9, and  \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8.</p> <p>\u05d2\u05d0\u05dc. In all the Versions the same word, one which means or can mean \u2018redeem\u2019, is used in many cases to render both \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 (and in some degree also for \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7). But the distinctive features of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc are also reflected. In LXX and Vg it is the \u2018family\u2019 dimension which is most clear, from the use of \u1f00\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u0301\u03c9 and words like propinquus (this dimension appears only infrequently, it seems, in Tg and Pesh). In Tg and Pesh the reference to vengeance is marked either by the retention of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc  as a loanword (in TgO and TgJ) or by the use of  \u05ea\u05d1\u05e2/\u2009\u072c\u0712\u0725 (tb\u02bf\u2009) (Palestinian Tgs and Pesh).  In Pesh \u072c\u0712\u0725 (tb\u02bf\u2009)\u00a0is, more surprisingly, also used in Ruth, perhaps in the more general sense of \u2018making a claim\u2019 for someone. The wider sense of \u2018deliverance\u2019 is also recognised in some uses of \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, libero and \ufb2a\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1.</p> <p>\u05e4\u05d3\u05d4. See above on \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and also on \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2. The idea of payment is sometimes reinforced by pretium in Vg. References to family connections do not appear in the Versions\u2019 renderings. A more general meaning \u2018deliver\u2019 appears in the use of \u1fe5\u03c5\u0301\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 or \u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u0345\u03b6\u03c9, libero or eruo and p\u1e63y or \u0161yzb.</p> <p>\u05e4\u05e8\u05e7. In LXX and Vg words for \u2018redeem\u2019 are used where there is a personal object, no doubt as a reflection of this sense in Aramaic; elsewhere a variety of words for \u2018removal\u2019 are used. In Tg and Pesh the use of \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7/\u2009\u0726\u072a\u0729 (prq) itself occurs more widely as a result of its various meanings, which include \u2018remove\u2019. </p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/overview_deliverance/#iii-summary","title":"(iii) Summary","text":"<p>In a number of ways the versional renderings coincide with the semantics of the lexical group or individual members of it as these were expounded above on the basis of other criteria. For example, the special characteristics of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 and the difference between them are visible, though in differing degrees. The use of different equivalents in different contexts for e.g. \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc and again \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 draws attention to their different senses. The opposition (in the technical linguistic sense) between \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc is quite strongly represented, and this could well be attributed to the divergence over the feature of \u2018separation\u2019 (i.e. use with \u05de\u05df) between these verbs: the preferred equivalents in each case would support this. The special position of \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 and its links with \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 are also reflected in the Versions.</p> <p>On the other hand our survey has exposed a tendency to blur the differences between the lexemes by the use of a restricted number of equivalents for them. This is particularly noticeable in the Tg and Pesh where two Aramaic words predominate in each case (the TgK  side with Pesh for some reason in the specific vocabulary used) and divide the group (with the exception of \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8) into two broad divisions. The Versions\u2019 renderings also leave the position of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 unclear, because they point to its close association either with \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 (and in Vg with \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8) or with \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc, \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4, and  \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7, implying perhaps \u2018rescue\u2019 in the one case and \u2018redemption\u2019 in the other.</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/overview_deliverance/#3-concluding-summary","title":"3. Concluding summary","text":"<p>Our examination of the individual lexemes has shown that some, in fact most, of them have a range of meaning that embraces more than deliverance from a general situation of trouble or danger. They may additionally refer to a quite specific kind of trouble or danger, like \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4. Or they may also be used of actions that do not involve trouble or danger at all, such as \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7 and some forms of the root \u05e0\u05e6\u05dc. In both these situations the wider use may contribute distinctive elements of meaning to the standard uses. Such features may help to identify the distinctive meanings or \u2018oppositions\u2019 (in the structuralist sense) of the words in the \u2018lexical field\u2019, though they need to be combined with other kinds of data (especially syntagmatic relations).</p> <p>One method which can contribute to the clarity of such distinctions is componential analysis. (I am using the method here in a less far-reaching way that when it is applied to the analysis of the meanings of particular lexemes individually, though the two enterprises are and should be related.) If we go back to the broad definition of deliverance given earlier, we can break it down into three essential components: [an action], [a person who benefits from it] and [a situation of danger or trouble]. Some of the verbs are strongly associated in their pattern of use with removal from a situation of danger or trouble, and this is indicated especially by the frequency with which they are followed by the separative preposition \u05de\u05df. \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc is the most frequent member of this sub-group, but \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 is another. In fact both \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 belong here, but in slightly different ways: \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 tends to express (I put it like that because there are inevitably some exceptions) removal from danger, while \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8  tends to mean arrival at a place of safety (Williams 2002).   </p> <p>Other verbs that we have treated occur less often, if at all, with \u05de\u05df, and it might be argued that when they are used with \u05de\u05df the explanation is syntactical rather than lexical: i.e. we are dealing with a \u2018pregnant\u2019 use of the combination in which another verb expressing the idea of removal is implied.11 A clear case of this is \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8. This verb normally lays greater emphasis on the benefit to the person concerned (\u2018help\u2019) than on removal from danger or trouble as such. And the same is probably true of \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2: this is reflected in the popularity of modern words for \u2018help\u2019 in recent dictionaries of Hebrew (cf.  ThWAT and THAT.).  It may also explain why this verb\u2019s associated nouns are so frequent: nouns cannot so easily be associated with a prepositional phrase as with a pronominal suffix which refers to the doer or the beneficiary of the action.</p> <p>Other words in the group are distinguished by what they say about the action itself. \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7 appears to mean \u2018violent removal\u2019, mainly of things rather than persons. As such it perhaps has little concern with the person who benefits. \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc is another example of a verb focused on a particular kind of action, although it is much debated which of the components of its specific legal meaning also apply to its theological use. \u2018Action by a family member\u2019 is perhaps the most generally applicable description, though \u2018restoration to a former state of well-being\u2019 applies to most cases too (the PNs are the most difficult for this). The idea of \u2018payment\u2019 of a price seems not to be implied in the theological use. \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 probably belongs here too, with an idea of \u2018liberation\u2019 being implied in the theological use, but not a payment (again the PNs raise some difficulty for this).</p> <p>Another issue that arises about this lexical field is whether some or all of its members have an essential or predominant theological component to their meaning. This was maintained by Sawyer for \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, which he suggested was \u2018one of a small group of \u201cdisinfected\u201d words (cf. BARA\u02be\u2009 \u2018to create\u2019), properly used only where YHWH or his appointed leader is subject\u2019.12 Similarly it has been maintained that \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc is used \u2018overwhelmingly with a divine subject\u2019.13 Even within the Old Testament corpus this plays down the significance of those places where these verbs have a human subject. But it also fails to recognise that the Old Testament is a very theological book, or collection of books, so that it is not surprising that a divine subject frequently occurs with these and many other verbs. One would like to be able to test such claims by reference to non-theological texts. There are some such texts in the Old Testament, namely Song of Songs and Esther. The Song appears to contain none of the \u2018deliverance\u2019 words (which may well be due to its subject matter), but Esther does have the only case in BHeb.  of \u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d4 (4:14) and an occurrence of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 (4:13),  neither with a divine subject. Hebrew inscriptions provide another possible test, but the few occurrences  (1x \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc;  4x \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2; cf. \u05d4\u05d2\u05d0\u05dc on coins)  are probably all in religious contexts. There are, it should be noted, a large number of proper names in inscriptions which include elements from the lexical field, but they are probably all theophoric or abbreviations of theophoric names, so they do not change the picture. So it is on the Old Testament evidence that the issue has to be judged, and as noted there are sufficient instances of the verbs being used with a human subject to show that it is not their meaning but their usage that has a strong theological dimension there.</p> <p>It has not been part of the Cambridge centre\u2019s working method to explore the use of lexemes in different \u2018functional languages\u2019 of ancient Hebrew,14 although we do from time to time refer, for example, to the usage in legal texts. An issue of particular interest is whether some of the lexemes considered are restricted to, or predominantly used in, prose or poetry.15 In a broad perspective it can be said that all the word-groups (roots) are well represented in both prose and poetry, with a slightly larger number of occurrences in poetry which may well be due to the frequency with which the topic of deliverance is treated in the Psalms and in prophecy. But there are some noteworthy differences both within and between word-groups.16 \u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2 and related nouns are significantly more frequent in poetry than in prose. For the verb the ratio of poetic to prose occurrences is about 2:1 (higher in the Niphal), and apart from \u05ea\ufb2a\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 (14x prose, 21x poetry) the related nouns occur almost exclusively in poetry: even \u05d9\ufb2a\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 occurs only five times (out of 78) in prose. For \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc the distribution is more even (93/216 in prose; also the one occurrence of a related noun), but this is partly due to the concentration of the Piel and Hithpael, which have non-deliverance meanings, in prose. There is an even more striking contrast between the verbs \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, with the latter being entirely poetic and the former slightly more common (50/94) in prose. It is, however, mainly the Niphal of \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 that accounts for the prose occurrences, while nouns related to \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 are also more common in prose (approximately twice as frequent as in poetry). \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and (to a lesser extent) \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 and related nouns are more frequent in prose, but the imbalance is largely accounted for by occurrences in legal texts (and for \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc the special case of the book of Ruth): neither is at all common in narrative prose. The few occurrences of \u05e4\u05e8\u05e7 and related nouns are evenly distributed between prose and poetry, but all the \u2018deliverance\u2019 cases are in poetry, suggesting (as far as the limited evidence goes) that this semantic development is a feature of poetic style.</p> <p>Finally, it has been our hope to draw some conclusions about diachronic aspects of the semantics of this lexical field, but so far we have had more success in calling in question some well known assertions than in identifying positive indications of change through time. Epigraphic evidence of proper names confirms that non-legal uses of \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc and \u05e4\u05d3\u05d4 were already established in pre-exilic times, and also that the verb \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, which is sometimes claimed to be \u2018late\u2019 in BHeb., was well known in the monarchy period. One aspect of the data which we are collecting and analysing which may take us further is the evidence from Qumran. This is of course of interest in its own right, and the progress of dictionary projects focused on this material will be of help to many others as well as to ourselves. But, as Avi Hurvitz pointed out, Qumran usage is a valuable clue for the detection of linguistic change within the Old Testament itself, particularly in the recognition of features of \u2018Late Biblical Hebrew\u2019. Further work on our data may also identify changes in the meanings and uses of words for deliverance. To refer to \u2018further work\u2019 is a reminder of the purpose of all our work in the SAHD project: it is first and foremost to assemble the data and make them conveniently available, not to find answers to all the questions that we or others might have. It is a tool for further research, which can be modified in the light of it, not the last word on the semantics of ancient Hebrew.</p> <p>January 2011, revised December 2017</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/overview_deliverance/#table-of-entries-and-authors","title":"Table of Entries and Authors","text":"LEXEME DATE COMPLETED AUTHOR(S) APPROX.

It became apparent to these scholars that a large computer database had many advantages over traditional methods of publication for such a project. The group was widened to include specialists in Hebrew, related languages and linguistics from several European countries and from Israel, and an outline plan was agreed. In 1991 the European Science Foundation agreed to establish and fund a Scientific Network on \u201cThe Semantics of Classical Hebrew\u201d under the chairmanship of Professor J. Hoftijzer (Leiden) for three years, so that both theoretical and practical aspects of the design of a semantic database for an ancient language could be explored. These preliminary investigations were carried out in three workshops (Strasbourg, June-July 1992; Florence, April 1993; Cambridge, September 1993 - see Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Althebr\u00e4istik VI/1 (1993) and VII/1 (1994)) and a Symposium (Leiden, July 1994), and a detailed plan for future work was agreed. In February 1994 the Standing Committee for the Humanities of the European Science Foundation expressed its satisfaction with the activities of the Network and recommended them as being \u201cof great intellectual significance and worthy of being assisted in the next stage of its work\u201d. [Further details of the work of the Scientific Network can be found in the ESF publication Scientific Networks (1993), pp. 46-47.] This document was originally prepared and approved by the Co-ordinating Committee of the Scientific Network (which is what is referred to in what follows as \u201cThe Committee\u201d), but it has been revised and agreed by the Executive Committee which will in future be responsible for the direction of the project (see the section below on Organisation).</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#aim-of-the-project","title":"Aim of the Project","text":"<p>It is not the aim of the project to add a new kind of dictionary to the already existing ones, nor to tackle a semantic study on the basis of a special method or methods. Its purpose is to prepare a tool which can be a useful inducement to further semantic research. It will provide a badly needed survey of the results and arguments found in scholarly literature. Thus it will prevent for everyone who uses it the loss of valuable time. Moreover it is planned in such a way that it will be clear not only what work has already been done, but also which workable way of approach has not been used for the study of the lexeme in question. In this way it will stimulate future research by drawing attention to what needs to be done and it will act as a stimulus to fresh, original research. It goes without saying that particularly research in which modern types of approach are used will be encouraged.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#organisation","title":"Organisation","text":"<p>These aims can only be realised by international co-operation. The following European universities (represented by the scholars named) have so far indicated their readiness to establish centres for the work of the project, should the necessary funding be obtained: Bonn (Prof. Dr. H.-J. Fabry), Cambridge (Dr. G.I. Davies), Dublin (Prof. Dr. K.J. Cathcart), Florence (Prof. Dr. I. Zatelli), Leiden (Prof. Dr. T. Muraoka and Dr. K. Jongeling), Leuven (Prof. Dr. A. Schoors, Prof. Dr. M. Vervenne and Dr. P. Swiggers), Oxford (Prof. Dr. H.G.M. Williamson) and Paris (Prof. Dr. A. Lemaire). Each of these centres will have responsibility for a lexical field or a number of lexical fields (by \u2018lexical field\u2019 is meant a group of lexemes which have a distinct mutual sense-relation). This approach is preferable because the subdividing of the lexical material in this way lends coherence to the description and study of the individual lexemes. For these centres two levels of central management will be needed: a) an Executive Committee consisting of representatives of the associated centres, which will oversee the actual running of the project. b) an Advisory Group, which will include representatives of the ESF and the other funding bodies and some additional specialists in the field. One centre will be responsible for the construction and maintenance of the database. It will also undertake the programming necessary for the systematic organisation of the input of the database, make bibliographic provisions and oversee the dating and classification of texts. It will, like the other centres, have responsibility for a lexical field or fields. Leiden has been chosen to be this centre. Every centre will have one or more salaried co-workers. The work on the database can be completed in 10 to 12 years. This period will be subdivided into phases, each phase with its own objective.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#scope","title":"Scope","text":"<p>It has been agreed that the project will concentrate on the language of all texts in Ancient Hebrew: the Hebrew Bible, the Ancient Hebrew inscriptions, the Hebrew text of Ben Sira and the Hebrew Qumran texts.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#semantic-methods","title":"Semantic Methods","text":"<p>At the first workshop of the Scientific Network a thorough survey was given of the different types of semantic approach which are used (or: can be used) for the study of Ancient Hebrew. Particular attention was given to the question of the problems which arise when these approaches are used for the semantic description of a language (phase), like Ancient Hebrew, which we only know through a relatively small corpus of texts. The presupposition of the work proposed is that each of these approaches offers as such a legitimate way of tackling semantic problems and that each of them can contribute to a smaller or larger extent to their solution.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#framework","title":"Framework","text":"<p>In the database the arguments and results of semantic scholarly work will be collected in one framework, no matter which method or methods were used in the relevant publications or by the co-workers on the project themselves. For such a database a framework is needed in which the relevant data for each lexeme will be collected. This framework will reflect current insights into the relevant methods and their problems. It will be clear that, in view of the varied kinds of scholarly approach, a neutral way of describing the results arrived at by the application of each of them is needed. In this respect it appeared helpful to subdivide the framework into sections: for each line of approach (or: for a combination of related lines of approach) a separate section. In each of these sections the relevant results of scholarly work can be described according to the neutral descriptional method. During the second and third workshops of the Scientific Network a decision was reached on the definitive form of this framework. In this framework system sections dedicated to lexical fields will also be added. The division of the framework into sections helps to keep it surveyable and well-organised. In a final section a general survey will be given of the results reached in the other sections.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#descriptional-method","title":"Descriptional method","text":"<p>During the second workshop a neutral descriptional method was accepted which formally, to outward appearance, is the same as that used for componential analysis, without the presuppositions of this kind of approach. This componential description of the results found in scholarly literature should be clearly distinguished from componential analysis as a linguistic approach to semantic studies and from the theories embraced by its practitioners. The use of this descriptional method for the aims of the database is possible because it can easily be adapted for the description of the results of other methods than the one it was designed for originally.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#material-included","title":"Material included","text":"<p>In view of the relative uncertainty of nearly every solution in our field it was considered wise to be extremely careful before leaving out scholarly proposals and/or arguments as being invalid. This does not mean that results and arguments of scholarly work ought to be inserted indiscriminately into the framework. Each section (except the final one) will be subdivided into two subsections. In the first one those results and arguments are collected which after assessment are considered to be convincing, in the second one the other material.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#multi-dimensional-approach","title":"Multi-dimensional approach","text":"<p>During the second workshop it was decided that for the database the more sophisticated approach of a multi-dimensional nature was to be preferred, because it offers possibilities for the combination of data from different parts of one framework or from different frameworks, while leaving open the possibility of making printouts of every lexeme entry, which will always remain helpful. It was the opinion of the committee that the database should be maintained in ASCII format to keep it independent of operating systems and programs that might change over the years. During the third workshop there was presented a pilot project, in which demonstrations were given of how such a multi-dimensional approach could work in practice.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"<p>For a database system it is of course necessary to use a uniform system of general, basic terms. Such a system was discussed during the third workshop. It was decided to explore the possibility of the use of the descriptive terminology recently developed by a member of the Committee, Prof. Richter from Munich, on the basis of modern research. A list of grammatical and descriptional terms has been formulated, which can be used when the work on the database starts, also on the basis of the material provided by Prof. Richter. In this way one can ensure a real coherence for the database work and an effective co-ordination of the work of the different centres. The idea is that the input should be done according to the framework system, but the implementation will be such that the output will not be, as far as possible, defined by it. An offer of Dr. Burnard, a specialist in this field from Oxford, to make an analysis of the framework, using the proposed terminological system, in terms of SGML has been gladly accepted by the Committee.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#hierarchic-approach","title":"Hierarchic approach","text":"<p>To guarantee a satisfactory use of the multi-dimensional approach the introduction of a hierarchic code system is desirable. One could present a fixed code system with a hierarchic structure. However, in this way we would commit ourselves to one semantic approach, excluding other approaches, which would be undesirable. Therefore an approach which gives users the opportunity to make their own choices is preferable, because it makes many different approaches possible. In this way future users can approach a problem from e.g. a formal grammatical or a notional standpoint, according to their own wishes. Such a construction, which is technically possible, will be used for the database project.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#the-instructions-for-the-co-workers","title":"The instructions for the co-workers","text":"<p>The future co-workers on the database project need to be given a set of basic rules. For fruitful co-operation within each centre and among the centres it is of vital importance to have at one\u2019s disposal a set of rules which guarantees a uniform approach on a number of central points. Such a set of rules was presented at the third workshop, and agreement was reached about the definitive text. The co-workers will also be provided (by the organizing centre) with a bibliography containing basic lists of commentaries, handbooks to be consulted, agreed abbreviations and, wherever necessary, advice on the use of existing bibliographical reference works. Works not included in the range defined could be found and be referred to if they are cited in the primary selection of literature. The co-workers will also be provided with the framework text (with short introductory remarks), with the list of descriptional terms mentioned above and with a number of sample entries. These sample entries will be provided to avoid unnecessary and undesirable variation. There will be some scope for co-workers to add the results of their own research to what is found in the existing literature. But it is not their first task to supply answers to open questions. It is important that non-experts should not try to add material in specialised fields if they do not know them well (one could, for instance, think here of certain types of etymology and of the ancient translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Versions). In appropriate cases means for publication have already been offered by the Zeitschrift fr Althebr\u00e4istik and by the series Arbeiten zu Text und Sprache im Alten Testament.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#tagged-bible-text","title":"Tagged Bible text","text":"<p>The Committee wants to avoid overlapping with work already done by others. So, for instance, morphologically tagged Bible texts are in existence. During the third workshop Prof. Richter suggested the use of the tagged Bible text prepared by his institute in Munich. The Committee has considered this text acceptable for use by the co-workers on the database. It goes without saying that legal advice has to be sought on the copyright issues. A one-to- one rendering of the codes of this Bible text in English (which will be the language of the project) will be necessary. Moreover, the use of the Munich Bible text will be very helpful, because it was based on a manuscript text with Tiberian vocalisation, but was coded in such a way that it could also be viewed without the vocalisation and punctuation (added in the second half of the first millennium A.D.) and even without so-called matres lectionis (consonant signs used for indication of vowels already in the first millennium B.C. and partly added into the text later on). So comments in the database could be based on all these forms of the texts.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#specialists","title":"Specialists","text":"<p>It goes without saying that for cases where help from specialists is needed (for etymology, for instance, from Egyptologists, Akkadian scholars or Iranists), every centre (or group of centres) will look for their own specialists. In some cases it may be possible for a university which is not a main centre of the project to be associated with it for the purpose of giving specialist advice on such matters.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#relations-with-other-fields","title":"Relations with other fields","text":"<p>Although the project deals with the semantics of Ancient Hebrew, this does not mean that it will remain out of touch with the work of scholars in fields with a related character and related problems. Some such scholars were guests at the second and third workshops, and one of them gave a lecture at the latter workshop. We have learned from their experiences. The system designed by us is designed in such a way that, with some slight adaptations, it can also be applied to at least a number of their fields. We have considered this to be a second, very important, task. The system proved to be suitable not only for the semantic presentation of older Semitic languages (especially those known only through a relatively small corpus of texts), but also for the semantic presentation of a non-Semitic language like Old Armenian.</p>"},{"location":"store/project_description/#costs","title":"Costs","text":"<p>The main costs to be borne by each centre will be the salary costs of the research worker(s) there. Some provision will also need to be made for expenditure on equipment, reference works, consumables, travel (to meetings of the Executive Committee) etc. Each centre will calculate its requirements in accordance with local circumstances. In addition there will be some central costs to which it is hoped that each centre will make some contribution. These central costs will include the expenses of occasional meetings of the Advisory Group and the cost of services provided by the Leiden centre to the project as a whole, such as computer programming, handling and checking of material sent in by co-workers elsewhere, and the classification of biblical (and other) texts. There is a possibility that much of these central costs will be funded by a special grant. Drafted by J. Hoftijzer (Chair) and G. I.

The fact that the found beka weights vary in weight, is attributed to the existence of more than one weight standard (Diringer 1958: 228). However, it can also be explained by factors such as mistakes in the manufacture of the weights, inability to weigh accurately, and to wear and tear (cf. Cook 1988: 1052, 1054;  Kletter 1998: 71, 78, 140). Since the found beka weights originate from the same period and, as far as is known, come largely from the same area (Judaea), and are largely homogeneous in terms of material and shape, it is probable that these weights are based on the same standard of weight (Kletter  1998: 70\u201372). It is therefore likely that the same weight standard is to be applied to the \u05d1\u05bc\u05b6\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2 of Gen 24:22 and the one of Exod 38:26. It is true that for the \u05d1\u05bc\u05b6\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2 of Exod 38:26, unlike that of Gen 24:22, the standard of the \u2018sanctuary shekel\u2019 applies. But the question remains whether this standard set by the sanctuary would have deviated from the standard that was in normal use (see \u2192 \u05e9\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc ).</p>"},{"location":"words/beka_%E2%80%93_half_a_shekel/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>For the abbreviations see the  List of Abbreviations.</p> Barrois 1953        Augustin-Georges Barrois,      Manuel d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie biblique, 2 vols.,     Paris: \u00c9ditions Auguste Picard.

The K of Psalm 18 could be read either as a defective writing of  \u05de\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc or as  \u05de\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05b9\u05bc\u05dc (or indeed  \u05de\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc, the normal form). The Versions uniformly presuppose  \u05de\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc in both places and Luther and most modern EVV follow suit. But KJV followed the Q in each verse and recently NRSV (but not RSV) has done the same. It seems likely that the Q readings were used by the Masoretes to indicate the existence of the variant reading in the parallel text. The variation could have arisen through confusion of yodh and waw in the consonantal text. But which reading is to be preferred (if a choice must be made)? God or his name is occasionally described as a  \u05de\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc (Ps 61:4; Prov 18:10) and the combination with  \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea  makes some sense. The uniqueness of  \u05de\u05b4\u05d2\u05d3\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc might be cited as an argument for its originality, but it could just as well be the result of a scribal error. In the context  \u05de\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05bc\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc is much more likely because of the following nomen rectum \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9. If  \u05de\u05b4\u05d2\u05d3\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc were intended one would expect \u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9.  Hence this occurrence of  \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea is included above in A.2 rather than A.5.</p> <p>B.2  In Hab 3:8 the words  \u05de\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b9\u05ea\u05b6\u05d9\u05da\u05b8 \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 could in themselves  readily be understood as a nominal clause (cf. LXX, Tg, Vg), meaning  that Yhwh\u2019s chariots \u2018bring victory\u2019, as in the examples in A.6 above (for the use of an abstract noun as the predicate in a nominal clause see GK \u00a7141c). In the context, however, where the prophet is asking in effect why Yhwh has appeared in mighty power to do battle, this would make for a weak climax to the question, even if grammatically the words might be construed as a circumstantial clause: \u2018with your chariots bringing you victory\u2019. It may be for this reason that Pesh  \u0718\u0725\u0720 \u0721\u072a\u071f\u0712\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0726\u0718\u072a\u0729\u0722\u071f (w\u02bfl mrkbt\u02be dpwrqnk),  \u2018and on the chariots of your redemption/salvation\u2019, already made \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4  into an  attribute of \u05de\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b9\u05ea\u05b6\u05d9\u05da\u05b8, with some paraphrase to get round the problem of a nomen rectum following a suffixed form.

Various kinds of \u2018success\u2019 secured by divine acts of power and faithfulness can be denoted by the word.

The verb \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea,  \u2018sets up\u2019 might be understood to have God as its subject, but an indefinite subject equivalent to a passive is perhaps more likely  (cf.

Mordechai Ben Asher, for example, sees no semantic differentiation between non-animate nouns with both masculine and feminine forms (1978: 1\u201314).

This is also attested in Sir 32/35:25. In some passages, however, it seems to be used of the present experience of the righteous whose worship brings them into fellowship with heavenly beings (1QHa 20:3 = 4QHa 3:2-3; 26:10 = 4QHa 7 i 14; 4Q511 10:8:  cf.

It is found in the plural a few times, which may account for its possible use in reference to God\u2019s \u2018acts\u2019 (see A.4 below).</p> <p>A.2 \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 has a stative connotation, perhaps denoting \u2018protection\u2019, which is especially brought out by Isa 26:1 where  \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4  is set up like walls and ramparts. Verbs of motion are rare with  \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4  (Syntagmatics\u00a0A.1) and it is much more common with verbs of feeling  (Syntagmatics\u00a0A.3), speaking or seeing  (Syntagmatics\u00a0A.2). Verbs of positioning are also found (Syntagmatics\u00a0A.2) in contexts of battle.</p> <p>A.3  It is the nomen rectum of nouns denoting, amongst other things, power or protection (Syntagmatics\u00a0A.5)  and this is similar to the meaning of \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2, although  \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 is not found so often with this sense.</p> <p> A.4  The distinction between the masculine noun  \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 and the feminine \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4  is seen in  part to be merely that of poetic variation. Synonymous parallelism has a preference for matching nouns of the same ending, or for opposing them for contrast (Watson 1980). It seems clear, however, from the Syntagmatics and the Versions how  \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 and  \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4  differ in use.  \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 often appears  as the nomen rectum of \u2018God\u2019, to  indicate that God is the speaker\u2019s  \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2, whilst  \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 is found used more of God\u2019s acts. It may be that the shorter form was more adept to this use, involving as it did the addition of a pronominal suffix.  \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 also appears to be used frequently as nomen rectum of nouns denoting defence or strength.</p> <p>A.5  Although \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 may have the meaning \u2018help\u2019 (cf. Vg), this is rare in comparison to the use of \u05ea\u05bc\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4.</p>"},{"location":"words/protection/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>For the abbreviations see the  List of Abbreviations.</p>  Ben-Asher 1978    Mordechai Ben-Asher, \u2018The Gender of Nouns in Biblical Hebrew\u2019, Semitics 6: 1\u201314.

Root and Comparative Material","text":"<p>A.1 Root:  The noun \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 has cognates in several Sem. languages, namely in Akk., Ug., Phoen., PBHeb., JAram., and Arab. Von Soden (1981: 163)  suggested that \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 together with its cognates in other Sem. languages  is ultimately a loanword from Sumerian,  but this is an unfounded suggestion. The word\u2019s origin is unknown.</p> <p>A.2 Akkadian: The Akk. cognate pilakku (other spellings: pilaqqu, pilaggu)  means \u2018spindle\u2019 (CAD P, 371-73). The same word is often written as BAL,  the logographic equivalent of pilakku. The logogram is often but not always preceded by the determinative GI\u0160 (GI\u0160BAL), which  indicates that the object is made of wood. The word pilakku was widely used and occurs in older as well as younger Akk. texts. Lexical texts show that it was also used in Ebla (GI\u0160BAL =  b\u00ed-a-gu;  Krebernik 1983: 16, no. 459) and  Emar (BAL = palakk/qqu;  WSEmar, 138; Arnaud 1987: 68).  None of the  occurrences demands the meaning  \u2018spindle whorl\u2019, which is designated as qaqqad pilakki, \u2018the head of the  spindle\u2019 (CAD P, 373). Lexical texts mention the \u2018hooked spindle\u2019 (pilak qarni; CAD P, 372), whose hook probably served to prevent the fibres or yarn from slipping away. The texts refer to spindle whorls made of algami\u0161u stone (probably steatite)  as well as spindle whorls made of tamarisk and other kinds of wood (CAD P, 373). Large numbers of expensive spindles (BAL.ME\u0160), made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, alabaster, horn, etc., were included in the gift which King Tu\u0161ratta of Mitanni sent  to Egypt according to EA 25 III:70-72.  The golden spindles are said to have a total weight of 8 shekels  and the 26 spindles of silver are said to weigh 10 shekels altogether, which probably means that a single silver spindle weighed around 3 grams (according to the Babylonian weight system; ca. 4.5 grams each if the Hittite system was used).  The interpretation as \u2018spindles\u2019 is certain.3 Rainey\u2019s unusual interpretation of BAL.ME\u0160 as representing the plural of maqq\u00fb, \u2018libation bowl\u2019,4  is unacceptable in view of the small weight of the objects.  Some Akk. inventories and dowry  lists mention among a married wife\u2019s possessions  spindle boxes made of wood or copper (GI\u0160/URUDU\u00c9.BAL =  b\u012bt pilakki;  GI\u0160PISAN.BAL; CAD P, 372\u201373). </p> <p>A.3 Ugaritic: The Baal myth contains the following lines with regard to the goddess Athiratu:  \u02bea\u1e2bdt.plkh\u200a[.bydh\u200a] / plk.t\u02bflt.bymnh (KTU 1.4:II.3-4).  The noun plk, which occurs in each of the two lines,  is usually interpreted as \u2018spindle\u2019 (Watson 2007: 673-77; DULAT\u200a3, 661) and the lines can be translated as follows: \u2018She took  her spindle [in her hand], an exalted spindle in her right hand\u2019 (Smith &amp; Pitard 2009: 434). Watson (2007: 678) proposed to interpret plk as \u2018perfume\u2019, \u2018soap\u2019. However, with reference to an Ug. spindle whorl inscribed with the word plk (RS 5.179; KTU 9.2; see Sauvage &amp; Hawley 2013; cf. section 6.3 A.1), he recently adopted the usual interpretation as \u2018spindle\u2019 (Watson 2018: 380). Translating plk as \u2018spindle\u2019 is also quite likely in view of a quadrilingual glossary from Ugarit, in which Sumerian BAL, Akk. p\u00ed-la-ak-ku, Hurrian te-a-ri, and  Ug.  p\u00ed-la-ku  are equated (RS 20.123+; Ugaritica 5: 137 II:22\u2019). Interestingly, in a damaged passage at the beginning of  the story of Elkunir\u0161a, Athiratu\u2019s counterpart  A\u0161ertu seems to use a spindle as a weapon (CTH 342; see COS i: 149; text partially reconstructed).</p> <p>A.4 Phoenician: The Azatiwada Inscription (8th cent. BCE) shows the following phrase:  wbymty \u02benk \u02be\u0161t tk l\u1e25dy dl plkm (KAI 26 A II:5-6).  Its interpretation  is disputed.  DNWSI (915-16, s.v. plk1),  takes difficult dl plkm as \u2018with spindles\u2019, but lists various other  interpretations. Younger (1998: 32-33) also lists deviating interpretations, but points out that the parallel Hieroglyphic Luwian text includes the logogram \u2018FUSUS\u2019,  which roughly has the form of a spindle and supports the interpretation of plk as \u2018spindle\u2019. He translates the phrase as follows:  \u2018But in my days, (especially) mine, a woman can walk alone with her spindles\u2019. </p> <p> Figure\u00a01:\u00a0\u00a0 Luwian hieroglyph denoting a spindle</p> <p>A.5 Postbiblical Hebrew: The noun \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 does not occur in Ben Sira and the non-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls, but still occurs in living usage in rabbinic literature.  bKetubbot 72b refers to a woman using a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 (in the same passage also Aram. \u05e4\u05bc\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05d0) for spinning (\u2192 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d4).  tKelim Bava Batra 1:6 includes the expression \u05d8\u05b8\u05d5\u05d5\u05bc\u05d9 \u05e9\u05b6\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc \u05d2\u05bc\u05b7\u05d1\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05da,  \u2018spun (wool) which is on the spindle\u2019.

A similar interpretation is found in the Talmud, which regards the curse concerning the \u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 as fulfilled with King Asa\u2019s foot disease (bSanhedrin 48b, with reference to 1 Kgs 15:23).  Some Heb. dictionaries (Gesenius, TPC II, 1105; Zorell, 651) also suppose that in 2 Sam 3:29 \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 designates  the stick of an ill person, although they affirm that it designates a spindle in Prov 31:19.  However,  Steven Holloway (1987: 371) rightly remarks: </p>  While a desire for the crippling of an enemy falls naturally enough within the general conceptual  pool of the treaty-curse, philological warrants are lacking. The Greek itself is suspect: in order to convey the idea of staff  as walking stick or crutch one would expect  \u03b2\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 or \u03c1\u0314\u03b1\u0301\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 rather than a noun with the primary meaning of cudgel or club \u2014 a weapon.  There is no cognate usage of plk which firmly points to a meaning of staff or crutch.   <p>Most dictionaries interpret \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 both in 2 Sam 3:29 and Prov 31:19 as a spindle or spindle-whorl.16  The interpretation as a spindle in 2 Sam 3:29 is not only in agreement with Prov 31:19, but it is also confirmed by several  ancient translations  (\u03b1\u0374, \u03c3\u0374, Pesh, Vg)  and the many cognates in other Sem. languages  (see already Driver 1913: 250-51).  The interpretation of \u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 as \u2018(male) holder of a spindle\u2019 seems to be reflected in Talmud Yerushalmi, where a comment attributed to Rabbi Ishmael (early 2nd cent. CE) connects the expression with the ill treatment of King Joash by the Arameans  (2 Chron 24:24). The comment interprets this treatment as sexual violation, as if Joash were a woman:  \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5\u05bc \u05de\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05de\u05b0\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b4\u05e9\u05bc\u05b8\u05c1\u05d4,  \u2018they violated him as they violate a woman\u2019 (yQiddushin 1, 61a). </p> <p>That having a \u2018(male) holder of a spindle\u2019 in a family with military commanders  was regarded as a severe curse seems quite likely against the background of ancient Near Eastern texts, in which the spindle is a symbol of effeminacy (see Hillers 1964: 66-68) and feminised warriors are regarded as weak (Bergmann 2007: 664-68). In Hittite texts, both spindle  (GI\u0160\u1e2bue\u0161a\u0161, GI\u0160BAL) and distaff (GI\u0160\u1e2bulali) are symbols of femininity. In a Hittite prayer, the goddess I\u0161tar is asked to deprive the enemies of their manliness including their weapons and to give them  a woman\u2019s distaff and spindle instead (CTH 716; see COS i: 164-65, \u00a78).  The First Soldiers\u2019 Oath threatens soldiers with loss of their manliness if they transgress the oath,  which is illustrated by a ritual indicating that their weapons will be replaced by a distaff and a spindle and other symbols of femininity (CTH 427; see COS i: 165-67, \u00a79). A ritual against the sexual impotence of a man includes placing a spindle and distaff in the man\u2019s hand  and, consequently, replacing it by a bow and arrows (CTH 406; see Hoffner 1987: 272, 277, 283).  For the relevant Hittite texts and terminology, see also  HW\u200a\u200a2 III/2: 632-33, 690-91. </p> <p>Akk.  texts refer to men with female apparel and implements who play a role in specific contexts:  the cult of the goddess Inana/I\u0161tar, who could alter a person\u2019s sex (Hillers 1964: 66-67),  and the cult of goddesses associated with her (cf. CAD K, 557-59, s.v. kurgarr\u00fb).  The kurgarr\u00fb men (L\u00da.KUR.RA.ME\u0160) performing in the cult of the goddess Nanaya are said to make use of a spindle (pilakku),  a whip, etc. (SAA 3: 13, text 4; CAD K, 558). A male servant of the goddess Dilbat reports to the king that he carries (ana\u0161\u0161i)  a spindle (GI\u0160pilaqqu) for the goddess  (SAA 10: 69, text 92). After categories of temple personnel, a lexical list mentions a L\u00da-GI\u0160-BAL-\u0160U-DU7 = n\u0101\u0161 pilaqqi,  \u2018(male) carrier of a spindle\u2019 (MSL 12, 103: 217; 135: 198a). </p> <p>The following curse in Esarhaddon\u2019s Succession Treaty may indicate that also in Mesopotamia, outside the specific cultic contexts, holding  a spindle was regarded as a disgrace to men: \u2018May they (the gods) make you whirl(?)17 like a spindle (GI\u0160pilaqqu), may they make you like a woman  before your enemy\u2019 (SAA 2: 56, text 6, \u00a791).  Brigitte Groneberg (1986: 190-91) assumed that the reference to the movements of the spindle reflects the dancing of transvestites in the cult of I\u0161tar. She interpreted the curse as  \u2018m\u00f6gen sie (die G\u00f6tter) euch surren lassen (d.h. die Transvestie durchf\u00fchren)\u2019.  The idea that depriving soldiers of their masculinity and turning them into women was a curse occurs also  in the treaty of A\u0161\u0161ur-Nerari V with King Mati\u2019-Ilu of Arpad (COS iv: 151-52; V:8-15) and other Akk.  texts (Bergmann 2007: 666-67).</p> <p>In view of all this extra-biblical evidence, David\u2019s use of the  expression \u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0,  \u2018(male) holder of a spindle\u2019, in 2 Sam 3:29 becomes understandable.  This part of the malediction must have been quite shocking to relentless military  commanders like Joab and his brother Abisai (cf. 1 Sam 26:6-9; 2 Sam 3:22-27, 39; 16:9-11; 18:5-15; 19:21-22; 20:4-12). It corresponds with biblical curses implying that enemies become (like) women and, consequently, will be defenceless  (Isa 19:16; Jer 50:37; 51:30; Nah 3:13; cf. Bergmann 2007: 668-72).</p> <p>A.3 Some dictionaries (BDB, 813; KBL, 763; HALOT, 933)  assume that \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 refers to the whorl of the spindle, while other dictionaries (GB, 643; Zorell, 651;  DCH vi: 696) suppose that \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 denotes the entire spindle. Except for the late cognate in Arab., the cognates in other Sem. languages designate the spindle in its entirety.  Even if the derivation of\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0\u008f from a root meaning \u2018to be(come) round\u2019 is correct (see section 1 A.7),  the word can still designate the entire spindle just as well as the whorl of the spindle, since both the whorl and the shaft of the spindle were round. Moreover, the fact that the two contexts in which \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 occurs indicate explicitly that it was held (2 Sam 3:29: \u05d7\u05d6\u05e7 hiph. with \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0;  Prov 31:19: \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05de\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 qal) suggest that \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 designates the spindle as a whole, since the whorl had to twirl freely.

Although the word \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 does not occur there, the description probably implies that  these women, who are said to have spun with their hands (\u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b6\u05d9\u05d4\u05b8; v.\u00a026), made use of a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0.

He regarded \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 in this verse and in Nehemiah 3 as a derivative of  Akk.  pilku B, \u2018corv\u00e9e\u2019 (see  Introduction)  and pointed out that in Ezek 27:9, 27 and Neh 3:4-32 \u05d7\u05d6\u05e7  hiph. means \u2018to repair\u2019. However, Scott Layton objected and demonstrated that  the combination of \u05d7\u05d6\u05e7 hiph. and the preposition -\u05d1\u05bc\u05b0  never means \u2018to carry out repairs among\u2019 (Layton 1989: 81). He rightly remarked that \u2018in every occurrence of this verb + preposition idiom, the noun which follows the preposition is the person or thing (abstract or concrete) which is grasped or held fast\u2019 (Layton 1989: 82). Further, he pointed out that the closest parallels to \u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0  occur in Prov 31:19 and the Ugaritic Baal myth, where \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0/plk is the object of verbs meaning \u2018to hold/grasp\u2019, \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05de\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 and  \u02be\u1e2bd, respectively (Layton 1989: 83).  Of course, the fact that several ancient translations interpreted \u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 as referring to the holding of a spindle is also significant.</p>"},{"location":"words/spindle/#62-pictorial-material","title":"6.2 Pictorial Material","text":"<p>A.1  The pictorial material from Egypt relates mainly to the production of linen from  the fibres of flax (A.2), while the pictorial evidence from the rest of the ancient Near East concerns mainly the production of wool threads (A.3). Since flax needs regular access to water during cultivation, it is not surprising  that in Egypt linen was more widely used than in the rest  of the ancient Near East, where the use of wool predominated. The constant presence of water in some areas outside Egypt, for instance near the  central Jordan river and in the Beth Shean valley,  made it possible to cultivate flax also there (Shamir 1996: 142), but from those areas no relevant pictorial evidence remains. Flax and wool have different properties and, consequently, their fibres had to be processed differently before they could be spun.18</p> <p>A.2  Ancient Egyptian depictions of the consecutive stages of textile production include representations of spindles and help to understand how they were  used.19 Although several depictions seem to be somewhat schematic, they  demonstrate that the processing of flax into linen went differently from the processing of wool.</p> <p>In ancient Egypt, the spindle whorl was placed near the top of the spindle.  Before the high-whorl spindles were used, the long flax fibres were spliced into continuous threads by twisting the ends of the fibres together (Barber 1991: 46-48; Andersson Strand 2015: 45-46). The spinners, mostly women, drew these thin threads from spinning bowls in which the threads were apparently wetted to make the flax flexible (cf. Olofsson et al. 2015: 81).  The spindles were not used to produce threads from unconnected fibres but merely to add twist to already-formed threads, often two or more threads that were twisted together to produce thicker, stronger threads. Elizabeth Barber suggests that the BHeb. verb  \u2192 \u05e9\u05c1\u05d6\u05e8 (see \u05e9\u05c1\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1 \u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05d6\u05b8\u05e8, \u2018twisted linen\u2019; Exod 26:1, 31, 36, etc.) refers to the same method of making linen threads (Barber: 1991: 50, 72). With regard to certain depictions of only a single thread per spindle, she observes (Barber 1991: 48):</p>  The fact that in some pictures we are shown spinners pulling only one thread per spindle may be a simplification on the part of the artist, but it may also show a practice of adding a strengthening twist to the fine \u2018single\u2019 yarns \u2026    <p> </p> <p> Figure\u00a02:\u00a0\u00a0 Spinning and weaving scene from the tomb of Khnumhotep II.

The woman standing right is processing threads, which she pulls from two spinning bowls. She adds twist to the threads with a suspended spindle. These threads  are consequently wound around the spindle rod.  This woman seems to hold a second spindle with a twisted thread attached to it behind her back. Other ancient Egyptian representations seem to display other spinning techniques. For instance, a wall painting in the tomb of Khety (also in Beni Hasan) shows spinners forming threads while  holding their spindle with one hand or both hands. One spinner seems to roll the spindle on the thigh, while another  draws the thread over a forked stick and apparently twists the thread by revolving the spindle with both hands (Dothan 1963: 105-06).  For the procedures and discussions of the Egyptian depictions, see Barber 1991: 44-51, 74; Spinazzi-Lucchesi 2018: 27-29, 97-101. </p> <p>A.3  A relief from Susa (western Iran, 8th to early 6th cent. BCE)  displays a woman whose hands hold a spindle onto which yarn has been wound (ANEP, no. 144). Reliefs on several neo-Hittite monuments from northern Syria and southeastern Turkey show women holding a spinning instrument in either their right or their left hand.  One of these reliefs displays a woman with yarn wound onto her spindle; see Figure\u00a03 (complete figure: Bonatz 2000: pl. 18 C 51).</p> <p> </p> <p> Figure\u00a03:\u00a0\u00a0 Detail of neo-Hittite monument from Mara\u015f, 9th to 8th cent.

The older interpretation of the spinning implements as pomegranates must be rejected, since no crowns of small leaves or other characteristics of pomegranates are displayed. The objects are possibly spindles (Hawkins 2000, I/1: 273), but according to Dominik Bonatz their blunt upper ends suggest that they are distaffs (Bonatz 2000: 85-86).  Bonatz also interprets an object held by a woman depicted on relief C 60 as a distaff, pointing out that from this object  a hand-twisted wool thread runs down to a wool box in which the roving is kept (Bonatz 2000: 79, 85, pl. 21). Of course, the representation of high-class women with spindles and distaffs suggests that these objects enhanced the status of these women. </p> <p> </p> <p> Figure\u00a04:\u00a0\u00a0 Neo-Hittite funerary stele of Tarhuntiwasti from Mara\u015f, 9th to 8th cent.

Spindle whorls are circular, often disk-shaped objects with a perforation in the centre that allows the rod to be inserted through it.  Remains of ancient spindles made of bone, ivory, or metal have been preserved across the Near East, but their number is quite small.20  Much more numerous are the surviving ancient spindle whorls without a rod.  Most of them are made of durable materials, such as stone, bone, reworked pottery sherds, or baked clay. They have been excavated all over the Near East, including Ugarit, Ebla, Hazor, Megiddo, Masada, and other sites in Israel/Palestine (Spinazzi-Lucchesi 2018: 34-48). </p> <p> </p> <p> Figure\u00a05:\u00a0\u00a0 Bone spindle with damaged rod,  Achzib, 8th to 6th cent. BCE Courtesy of Israel Museum, Jerusalem</p> <p>The preservation of so many spindle whorls without a rod is explicable. Most of the rods were made of wood, which usually decays in the more humid climate zones. However, especially in Egypt many spindles partially or entirely made of wood have survived.  In Egypt, not only most of the spindle rods but also numerous spindle whorls were made of wood (Spinazzi-Lucchesi 2018: 84-87, 107-15). While several ancient metal spindles from several parts of the Near East show either a groove or a hook near the top for attaching the first fibres (Barber 1991: fig. 2.19, 2.20, 2.22), many wooden spindles from Egypt show a groove near the top that was incised for the same reason (Spinazzi-Lucchesi 2018: 84-85, 109-10; Barber 1991: fig 2.7).  The total number of ancient wooden spindle whorls discovered in Israel/Palestine surpasses sixty (Sitry &amp; Langgut 2019: 44* n. 3). Chiara Spinazzi-Lucchesi refers to three very old examples from Jericho, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, that have survived thanks to favourable circumstances. She points out  that these whorls \u2018are very important because they give evidence for the use of wood to make these artefacts and remind us that the amount of spindle whorls at each site is always underestimated, as wooden ones are almost always lost\u2019  (Spinazzi-Lucchesi 2018: 41). Several dozens of wooden spindle whorls, presumably dating from the tenth century BCE, were found in Tell el-\u1e24ammah, in the central Jordan valley (Shamir 2007: 46). Wooden spindle whorls as well as a complete wooden spindle from the Early Roman Period were discovered in Wadi Murabba\u2018at and published in  DJD\u00a0II (41-43 with fig. 12:11, planche XIII).  The spindle has indentations at the upper end to prevent the fibres or thread from slipping away; see Figure\u00a06. In the Cave of the Letters (cave 5-6) in Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever, three wooden and two stone spindle whorls were found, together with a bundle of dyed, unspun wool and  balls of woollen and linen threads, all with 135 CE as the terminus ad quem (Yadin 1963: 35-36, 130-32, 169-88, 252, 256, plates 36, 59, 88).</p> <p> </p> <p> Figure\u00a06:\u00a0\u00a0 Wooden spindle, length 23.5 cm;  Wadi Murabba\u2018at, Early Roman Period Courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority <p></p> <p>The archaeological evidence demonstrates that spindles were already widely used  during the Late Bronze Age.  This is not surprising, since it was relatively easy to produce them and the materials of which they were usually made were cheap. Furthermore, spinning with a spindle was much faster than hand spinning,  which implied the twisting of fibres by hand or by rolling them against the thigh.  Other advantages of spinning with a spindle were that  its weight helped to keep the fibres taut and prevented the spun yarn from tangling and untwisting, while the whorl increased the regularity of the spinning.21  For these reasons, it is no surprise that the use of spindles was so widespread in the world of the Bible.  </p> <p>A vast majority of the excavated objects identified as spindle whorls weighs between 2 and 30 grams, but there are also examples of heavier whorls. Illustrative are the Late Bronze Age spindle whorls from Ugarit (Sauvage 2013: 192-95, 200-01), those from Iron Age II unearthed in Tel Miqne-Ekron (Shamir 2007: 45-46), and whorls from the Hellenistic and Early Roman Periods  discovered at Gamla (Cassuto 2016: 272-75).  Most of the spindle whorls from Iron Age Jerusalem weigh also less than 30 grams,  but many are relatively heavy, with weights up to 200 grams (Shamir 1996: 149-52).</p> <p>In her description of the ancient spinning methods, Eva Andersson Strand  reports on recent spinning tests with modern reconstructions of ancient spindles. The tests demonstrated that,  contrary to earlier assumptions,  even very light whorls could be used to spin yarn.  The spindles with lighter whorls  appeared to produce thin yarn, while the spindles with heavier whorls produced coarser, thicker yarn (Andersson Strand 2015: 44-48; similarly  Olofsson et al. 2015: 77-87). While coarser, hard spun wool threads could be used as warp, more loosely spun wool could be selected for the weft. Andersson Strand gives the following description of the ways in which the spindles were used for the processing of wool fibres (2015: 45):</p>  The spindle shaft is rotated while the spinner simultaneously draws out the fibres, and it is the twisting of the fibres around their own axis that forms the thread. During spinning, the spindle can hang freely (a so-called suspended spindle) (\u2026), or it can be supported, with the shaft resting on the ground or in a bowl, or on the thigh. On a suspended spindle the whorl can be placed at the top (high-whorl), the bottom (low-whorl) or sometimes also in the middle (mid-whorl) of the shaft. On a supported spindle, the whorl is placed at the top of the shaft (\u2026). A third variation is the hand-held spindle, a shaft with or without a whorl that is turned within the hand (\u2026). Finally, a thread can be spun by using a hooked shaft; in this technique the spinner draws out the fibres and forms the thread by rolling the shaft against the thigh (\u2026).  The hook helps to control the fibres when they are drawn out.   <p>When a certain length of the thread had been spun, the finished part was wound around the rod of the spindle. Thereafter, the spinning was continued until the thread was finished or the rod had been filled with thread. Finally, the thread could be wound up on a reel, onto a weft bobbin or into a ball (Andersson Strand 2015: 47).  However, the spindle full of yarn could also be used as a shuttle during weaving, moving the woof yarn between the threads of the warp yarn (Rahmstorf 2015: 11).  Note that BAL,  the logographic equivalent of Akk.  pilakku,  was also used for Akk.  nabalkutu, \u2018to cross over\u2019 (CAD NI, 11-20).</p> <p>Spindles were not only used for producing individual strands of yarn, but also for plying  two or more strands together in order to get a plied yarn.  While the fibres of the individual threads had been twisted in the same direction, either to the right or the left, these threads were usually plied together in the opposite direction to create a balanced yarn, without the tendency to twist upon itself.22 Spindles with relatively large  and heavy whorls, such as the one from Ugarit inscribed with the word plk (cf. section 1 A.3; Sauvage 2013: 193, 201: 114.2 grams), may have been used for plying single threads of wool together (Sauvage &amp; Hawley 2013: 365, 372; Sauvage 2013: 204). For the plying of threads of flax fibres with a spindle, see section  6.2 A.2. In Tell el-\u1e24ammah, in the central Jordan valley, a spindle with linen threads still wrapped around it was found in the 10th-century BCE stratum (Shamir 1996: 142).  Unfortunately, figures and more details of this find are not available.</p> <p>Ancient spindles entirely or partially made of precious materials, such as copper, bronze, silver, gold, or ivory, have been discovered mainly in graves of women, but sometimes in domestic contexts.23  References to spindles made of such costly materials occur in several texts  (Hittite: HW 2 III/2: 632; El-Amarna: EA 25). Such precious spindles probably represent status symbols  rather than being tools of everyday use (Spinazzi-Lucchesi 2018: 30). </p> <p>A.2 Spinning bowls:  Ancient bowls with two (rarely one, three or four) interior handle-like loops have been discovered at several locations in Egypt and Israel/Palestine.  These bowls have been interpreted as spinning bowls.24 They were made to keep threads of spliced flax or threads of spun wool before they were twisted together with a spindle in order to get a plied yarn. The threads were passed through different loops to prevent them from entangling. The constant rubbing of the threads past the undersides of the loops left grooves, apparently due to the tension that was placed on them.  Part of the spinning bowls served also to wet threads of spliced flax to make them more flexible; see section 6.2 A.2 with Figure\u00a02. In Egypt such bowls appear to have been used during the second millennium BCE. These Egyptian spinning bowls were made of either clay or stone. The spinning bowls discovered in Israel/Palestine date from the Late Bronze Age until the middle of the first millennium and are made of clay.</p> <p>A peculiar jar from Israel/Palestine, presumably dating from late Roman or Byzantine times, was published and discussed by Joseph Naveh  (1979: 28-30, with plates opposite p. 29).  Unfortunately, the jar\u2019s provenance is unknown, but it carries an inscription with a word that seems to be related to \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0, namely  \u05e4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05df.  Naveh interpreted the word \u05e4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 as Aram. and translated \u05e4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05df as \u2018spinning vessel (of) Shimeon\u2019  (with reference to \u05e4\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d9\u05d4 in Qohelet Rabba, ad 7:9).  The jar is 29 cm high and has a maximum diameter of 23.5 cm. Before the clay was fired, the jar was provided with a sealed top with  seven small holes (ca. 0.5 cm wide),  a wide mouth on its shoulder (ca. 8 cm), and two exterior handles, one at each side of the mouth. Naveh convincingly argues that this peculiar spinning jar was made to hold balls of spun yarn. Such balls could be placed inside the jar through the mouth, while the yarns could be passed through the small holes at the upper side.  Above the jar, the strands could be plied together into heavier threads, supposedly with a spindle.</p>"},{"location":"words/spindle/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>A.1 Biblical Hebrew \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 is probably a primary noun. Most of the cognates in other  Semitic languages are also nouns and designate the same object as  \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0, namely a spindle. A cognate verb occurs only quite late,  in Arabic (falaka) and possibly also in Jewish Aramaic, which suggests that the verb is denominative. </p> <p>A.2 In biblical Hebrew, the noun \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 designates a spindle, an instrument consisting of a circular spindle whorl with a perforation in the centre through which a rod has been inserted. Spindles were used for spinning ( \u2192 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d4),  which implied either forming new yarn from raw fibres, or plying several strands together to form stronger, thicker yarn.</p> <p>A.3 The interpretation of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 as a spindle is beyond doubt in Prov 31:19.  The parallel noun  \u2192 \u05db\u05bc\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 may denote a distaff, a stick onto which wool or flax was wound that was consequently spun with the spindle. The fact that Prov 31:19 refers to a woman\u2019s ability to work with a spindle corresponds with the ancient Near Eastern evidence indicating that  this ability enhanced the reputation of women. </p> <p>A.4 With regard to \u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 in 2 Sam 3:29, the interpretation of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 as a spindle is also the most convincing option. This interpretation is confirmed by most of the ancient translations (\u03b1\u0374, \u03c3\u0374, Pesh, Vg).  The interpretation as a walking stick lacks a lexicographical basis and  it is dubious whether it can be defended  with reference to the rendering \u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c4\u1f71\u03bb\u03b7 in LXX. In extra-biblical texts from the ancient Near East, the spindle is a symbol of effeminacy. This confirms that having a \u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0, \u2018(male) holder of a spindle\u2019,  in a family comprising military commanders was regarded as a curse. Several modern translations rightly reflect the interpretation of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 as a spindle in 2 Sam 3:29: \u2018who holds a spindle\u2019 (NRSV), \u2018a man holding a spindle\u2019 (WYC), and, paraphrastically, \u2018fit only to do a woman\u2019s work\u2019 (GNTB).</p>"},{"location":"words/spindle/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>For the abbreviations see the  List of Abbreviations.</p>  Andersson Strand 2015 Eva Andersson Strand, \u2018The Basics of Textile Tools and Textile Technology: From Fibre to Fabric\u2019, in: Andersson Strand &amp; Nosch 2015: 39-60.

A metathesis of the two letters, \u2018ayin and shin/\u2009sin, in the verb has probably occurred in transmission, but it is difficult to say which was the original reading (see Tov 1992: 250). The frequency of the verb \u05e2\ufb2b\u05d4, however, with the direct object \u05ea\u05bc\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 suggests the wording of 2\u00a0Sam 23:12  is the original and that the metathesis at 1\u00a0Chron 11:14 has been occasioned by the noun calling to mind the (possibly) cognate verb.</p> <p>A.2  At Isa 64:4 the verb should probably be read as \u05d5\u05b7\u05e0\u05bc\u05b4\u05e4\u05b0\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2.</p> <p>A.3  Ms B at Sir 34:6 reads the niphal inf \u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05e2, but B-mg corrects this to the hiphil \u05dc\u05d4\u05d5\ufb2a\u05d9\u05e2, the error in B being explicable by the easy loss of a yodh.</p> <p>B.1  Although the LXX \u03b5\u0313\u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf (cf. Pesh: zk\u02be hw\u02be\u2009) at 1\u00a0Sam 14:47 implies the verb \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 rather than the MT reading \u05d9\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7, there is no sufficient reason for emending.</p> <p>B.2  Although the NAB (cited by Clines 1989) reads the verb \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 at Job 5:11, the MT reading of the noun \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 can be regarded as correct, if understood as an adverbial accusative (GKC: \u00a7188 q). See \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 Text Doubtful B.3, Syntagmatics A.3.</p> <p>B.3  The reading at D\u20131.008:4 is badly damaged and is doubted (see  HAE, 429).</p> <p>B.4  The three letters \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2  (with the yodh uncertain) appear on a late third-century/early second-century inscription from Mount Gerizim  (Naveh &amp; Magen 1997: 43, text D). Since the inscription is broken off immediately before these letters, it is not possible to determine whether this is a whole word or part of it. It may be significant to note that the context suggests some form of dedicatory prayer, and the possible appearance of the word \u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd (denoting resurrection?) could indicate that it is a prayer or Psalm to God. This would support the reading \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2, which, if it is the noun, reflects its appearance in poetry in the OT and most often in prayers and Psalms. The verb also appears most frequently in Psalms and could be an alternative reading here to the noun.</p> <p>B.5  In 1QHa 11:6 DCH iv: 336 and Dahmen (2013: 316) read  [\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9]\u05e2\u05ea\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9[\u05d9],  recalling the language of 10:25. But many scholars do not adopt this conjecture (e.g. Dupont-Sommer 1961: 207, Lohse 1971: 120 [numbering acc. to Sukenik: 3:6]) and the DSS.SE (164\u201365) prints \u05e2\u05ea\u05d4 as a complete word (\u2018Now\u2019) preceded by a vacat.

According to Sawyer (1990: 443) there are 14 proper names in the Hebrew Bible that are probably cognate, but this number is swollen by several that contain the element \ufb2a\u05d5\u05e2, supposedly a by-form of the root \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2. They may belong to a separate root altogether (see the sections on Root and Comparative Material for  \ufb2a\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b7, \ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7, and  \u05ea\u05bc\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4).  Even if they are not counted, there are certainly six in BH which contain instances of \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 (two with variant forms) and, in addition to some of these, others are found in Hebrew inscriptions: \u05d9\u05d5\u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2, \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2, \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2\u05d0, and  \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2\u05d4\u05d5 (cf. AHI-1: 282, 333-34, 371, 381-82; AHI-2: 132, 153, 169-70). In two of these names, \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 and (\u05d5)\u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2\u05d9\u05d4, it has been thought that Qal forms of the verb, which do not occur in BH, may be present (Noth 1928: 36, 176).</p> <p>A.2  The Proto-Semitic root *y\u1e6f\u02bf now seems to lie behind Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2,  being attested in proper names in NWSem and most of the ESA languages. The Ug evidence attests to the second consonant being \u1e6f (Sawyer 1975: 78). This new evidence counters some earlier interpretations based on Arab (see B.1). The main arguments outlined by Sawyer (1975) are the evidence of proper names in NWSem (A.3, A.4, B.3), the collocation of y\u1e6f\u02bf terms with deities\u2019 names (as with \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2; see A.1, 3, 5, 7-10; also Syntagmatics\u00a0A.1), chronological evidence (see A.5, 7-10) and phonological equivalence (B.1). Earlier KBL (412, along with wasi\u02bfa), Huffmon (1965: 215) and Stolz (1971: 786, citing Sawyer 1965: 475-76, 485) had supported this view; and at the conference where Sawyer originally presented his paper T.L. Fenton and H.W.F. Saggs had indicated their strong agreement with it (Sawyer 1975: 83-84). Significantly this view was adopted in the latest Hebrew lexicon to incorporate philological data (Ges18, 510 [1995]). Unfortunately the occurrences of y\u1e6f\u02bf do not give an independent indication of its meaning.</p> <p>A.3  The appearance of a root in a name is not evidence for a verbal form ever existing (cf. Sawyer 1975: 77), but the existence of this root in non-biblical theophoric proper names may correspond to the use of \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 in Hebrew personal names and as a verb with primarily God as the subject. The root-morpheme y\u1e6f\u02bf is attested relatively frequently in proper names in Amorite. It is the only Sem. language from the early second millennium B.C. in which the root appears. The earliest occurrence is the name la\u0161uil in a legal document from c. 2048 B.C. (Buccellati 1966: 165). The verbal form derived from this is ya\u0161u\u1e2b, found also in eight names from Mari (Huffmon 1965:215\u201316). The root appears to be frequent in Amorite names in comparison with some of the other NWSem. evidence.</p> <p>A.4  The verb appears in the Moabite inscription (KAI 181: line 4) in the expression h\u0161\u02bfny mkl h\u0161lkn, \u2018he delivered me from all assaults\u2019 (Segert 1961; Gibson 1971: 77\u201378). The noun might also appear in lines 3\u20134 \u2013  bmt [y]\u0161\u02bf, \u2018in the high place of salvation\u2019. For an alternative reading to bmt see Gibson 1971: 78.</p> <p>A.5  The root y\u1e6f\u02bf is attested in proper names in Ugaritic. It is found in the names y\u1e6f\u02bfd (Gr\u00f6ndahl 1967: 47) and perhaps y\u1e6fil, if it is a shortened form of y\u1e6f\u02bfil (Sawyer 1975: 78).</p> <p>A.6  The name Ya\u0161uya in Amarna letter EA 256 (line 18: mya-\u0161u-ia) has been identified with the Biblical name \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\ufb4b\ufb2a\u05bb\u05e2\u05b7, `Joshua\u2019 (Olmstead 1931: 188, 197; cf. Knudtzon  1915II: 1319;  Ges18, 449). The name \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\ufb4b\ufb2a\u05bb\u05e2\u05b7 is seen as a combination of a form of \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 and a noun derived from  \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 (Ges18, 449).1  This identification of the name Ya\u0161uya with the name \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\ufb4b\ufb2a\u05bb\u05e2\u05b7 was rejected by Albright (1943: 12 n. 27), arguing that the Akk. form should have been *Ya-\u1e2bu-\u0161u-u\u1e2b.</p> <p>A.7 The Aram. name hdys\u02bfy (Akk. adad-it-\u02bei) in ll. 1, 6 and 12 of the Tell Fekheriye bilingual inscription (KAI 309), probably of the mid-ninth century, can plausibly be associated with the root y\u1e6f\u02bf/\u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 (see initially Abou-Assaf et al. 1982: 43-44, 80: more recent bibliography in Millard 2000: 154). \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 is a loan-word in Aramaic found in the Prayer of Nabonidus (Milik 1956: 413) and in the Targum (Sokoloff, DJPA, ad loc.). Aramaized forms of two Biblical Hebrew names are found in the Elephantine papyri (Noth 1928: 154\u201355, 176).</p> <p>A.8  In Sabaean two personal names with the form hay\u1e6fa\u02bf or hay\u1e6fi\u02bf (Ryckmans 1934\u201335: I, 232; cf. 112) appear to correspond to the causative element, as in the Hebrew hiphil.</p> <p>A.9  One name with the root yt\u02bf is recorded in a Nabatean text (Cantineau 1930\u201332: II, 105).</p> <p>A.10  The root y\u1e6f\u02bf is attested in proper names in Epigraphic South Arabian (Ryckmans 1934\u201335: II, 10, 75\u201376), some of them very common. M\u00fcller (1963: 310; cf. HAL: 427) suggested associating \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 with ESA  ws\u02bf = \u2018reichlich geben, reichlich versorgen mit\u2019, but this does not seem to have been widely adopted. Many North Arabian personal names also include the element y\u1e6f\u02bf (see M\u00fcller 1979, who proposed an association of it with a different root y\u0161\u02bf = \u2018be high\u2019).</p> <p>B.1  The connection with Arab. wasi\u02bfa\u00a0 \u2018to be spacious\u2019, which in the causative conveniently corresponds morphologically with the Heb. hiphil, is made by many writers (e.g. Driver 1890: 90-91; HAL: 427; Fohrer 1964: 973; Kraus 1978: 139), although BDB (446) did express doubt in 1908. It seems to have first been proposed by Schultens (1761: 7-9; see Sawyer 1968: 20, nn. 1, 2, but Sawyer\u2019s page ref. is incorrect) and was supported by Gesenius (1810: 419 and TPC, 639-40, 1380). A proposed Proto-Hamito-Semitic root *ws\u02bf\u00a0 is apparent from Eg. \u2018to be wide\u2019, Berber usa\u02bf\u00a0 and Arabic ws\u02bf\u00a0 \u2018to be wide, spacious\u2019, but any semantic connection between this and \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 seems far-fetched. Sawyer notes that to connect this root with \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 would involve two exceptional correspondences, now that the latter is seen to be cognate with  y\u1e6f\u02bf/ y\u1e6f\u02bf: Eg. s with Sem. t and NWSem. t with Arab. s (1972:94).</p> <p>Since \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 has pe-waw forms in both its surviving conjugations, the Hiphil and the Niphal, it was natural to seek an Arabic cognate for it with initial waw and the correspondences \ufb2a/s and \u05e2/\u02bf, while not universal in either case, are widely attested. The idea that the underlying meaning of \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 could be \u2018(make) wide, spacious\u2019 finds support in the fact that there is an antonym in Heb., \u05e6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e8 I, \u2018be in/cause distress\u2019, with cognate nouns and an adjective, with another meaning \u2018narrowness\u2019, as already noted by Schultens (9), and occasionally occurrences of the two roots are directly related to one another (Judg 10:14; Isa 46:7; 63:9; Jer 14:8; 30:7; Ps 34:7; Neh 9:27; 2\u00a0Chron 20:9). There are difficulties, however, with these arguments. First, now that a possible alternative etymology, from Proto-Semitic *y\u1e6f\u02bf, has come to light, it turns out that the phonological argument is not as decisive as it previously seemed (on the possible problem of the initial  y in *y\u1e6f\u02bf see below on Formal Characteristics\u00a0A.1). Secondly, there is in fact no actual overlap in meanings between the attested uses of \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2  and those of wasi\u02bfa: \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 never means \u2018be wide\u2019 or \u2018make wide\u20192 and wasi\u02bfa never has the sense of \u2018save, deliver, help\u2019 (Lane 8[supplement], 3052-53).3 Thirdly, while \u05e6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e8 I is attested meaning both \u2018narrowness\u2019 and \u2018distress\u2019, it cannot be said to be established that \u2018narrowness\u2019 is the basic meaning from which \u2018distress\u2019 is derived. In fact \u2018narrow\u2019 in the physical sense is a rather rare meaning of the root. Finally, while \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 and \u05e6\u05e8\u05e8 do sometimes occur together, this is also true of \u05e0\u05e6\u05dc and \u05e6\u05e8\u05e8 (1\u00a0Sam 26:24; Pss 34:18; 54:9; Job 5:19), suggesting that the association may well be due to semantic considerations rather than related underlying etymologies (cf. Sawyer 1965: 475 n. 5).</p> <p>B.2  The possibility that both y\u1e6f\u02bf\u00a0 and Arab. wasi\u02bfa might go back to a common Proto-Semitic original was apparently envisaged by KBL (412), and the North-West Semitic evidence for y\u1e6f\u02bf might have developed from a Proto-Semitic *w\u1e6f\u02bf. But this is unlikely for ESA., where an initial waw is normally preserved, and the problem of \u1e6f = Arab. s noted by Sawyer (above, B.1) remains. The apparent use of s to represent  \u1e6f/\ufb2a in the OAram. name hdys\u02bfy at Tell Fekheriye (see Root and Etymology A.7) might seem to be a helpful \u2018bridge\u2019 between the two, but it is probably due to an orthographical peculiarity that is (so far) unique to this inscription, where it occurs in some other words (Abou-Assaf et al. 1982: 44).</p> <p>B.3  It has been suggested that the Moabite name Mesha on the Moabite stone (KAI 181; cf. 2\u00a0Kgs 3:4) was probably originally m\u014d\u0161a\u02bf (cf. LXX \u03bc\u03c9\u03c3\u03b1; Segert 1961: 246), but this seems unlikely. The verbal form also appears in the Moabite stone with the god Chemosh as subject. Gibson argues for a double base in proto-Semitic, one with the first consonant y- and one with w- (1971: 77).</p> <p>B.4  Although it is possible that the element i\u0161\u1e2bi- in 10 personal names from Mari is related, some argue that it is non-Amorite (see Huffmon 1965: 215).</p>"},{"location":"words/to_save%2C_help/#2-formal-characteristics","title":"2. Formal Characteristics","text":"<p> A.1  From a synchronic point of view \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 appears to be a pe-yodh root (in view of some of its nominal derivatives, \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 and \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4). But historically classification either as pe-yodh or as pe-waw is possible, since originally pe-waw verbs are at first sight pe-yodh too, as a result of the early North-West Semitic development of initial Waw in most cases into Yodh (Moscati 1964: 46). Indeed pe-waw is more obvious for \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 when consideration is given to the morphology of the Hiphil and Niphal forms of the verb. Ultimately its classification depends on the etymology which is accepted.</p> <p>A.2  Although the formation of the Hiphil (and the less common Niphal) is a good first indicator of the original first radical, it is not decisive, especially in a case where no other conjugations are attested. There is at least one case, \u05d9\u05d1\ufb2a, where a truly pe-yodh verb (cf. the retention of the yodh in the Qal imperfect and the Arab. cognate  yabisa) forms its Hiphil as if it were a pe-waw verb (the Niphal does not occur) and the same could be true for \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2. Modern grammars deal differently with this anomaly. GK places most such \u2018hybrids\u2019 under its heading \u2018Verbs originally Pe Waw\u2019 (\u00a769d-f) and only \u05d9\u05d1\ufb2a, which is treated very briefly, in the section for \u2018Verbs properly Pe Yodh\u2019 (\u00a770, cf. paras. a,c). However, BL treats them as pe-yodh with deviant forms in the Hiphil and Niphal (377i, k) and Bergstr\u00e4sser, who makes the form of the imperfect Qal his primary criterion for distinguishing the two main classes of pe-yodh verbs (weak and strong) apparently agrees (2, \u00a726n). JM (\u00a776d) artificially isolates the case of \u05d9\u05d1\ufb2a from the other hybrids (the wording here, like most of the treatment of this group of verbs, is that of Jo\u00fcon), but this is an unsatisfactory approach to the evidence. Whichever approach is preferred, \u05d9\u05b8\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 with yt\u02bf\u00a0 as its older form could be explained in the same way as \u05d9\u05d1\ufb2a.</p> <p>A.3  See BL, 229f for the form at 1\u00a0Sam 17:47 and Ps 116:6.</p> <p> B.1  The form \u05de\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 is the hiphil participle, although Sawyer notes that it has lost its participial and verbal characteristics, being used as the object of verbs of sending or appointing (1965: 477; cf.

It is also used in the time of the Judges of the protection from foreign nations (e.g. Judg 2:16, 18). Such military contexts apply the verb both to the acts of God (1\u00a0Sam 17:47) and to those of military heroes (e.g. Judg 6:14\u201315; 1\u00a0Sam 9:16).</p> <p>A.3  \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 is found in forensic contexts, but this need not be the original meaning (see B.1 below). Although it is primarily found with the noun \u05de\u05d5\u05b9\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 (e.g. Deut 28:29, 31) it may be implied with this sense in the appeal of the woman of Tekoa to David to help her in her case (2\u00a0Sam 14:4; Hubbard 1997: 557) and in some Psalms. The implication is that the king can dispense justice in the same manner that God does in the Psalms. The examples are few and the argumentation is tentative. In each of these instances one could argue that the verb \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 means merely \u2018to save\u2019 and that the context indicates the saving will be forensic. Certainly when an appeal to a king is made it denotes acquittal, but this is probably a developed sense from the general meaning.</p> <p>A.4  The idiom \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiphil + \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3 + \u05dc\u05b0 is used in the context of bloodguilt (1\u00a0Sam 25:26) and refers to taking revenge. It denotes specifically exercising justice oneself (with the implication that someone else has done or should do it). In Judg 7:2 God warns the Israelites that they might boast of executing the victory on their own part rather than giving credit to God (cf. Job 40:14). As already noted  (Syntagmatics A.7)  \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiph. is quite frequently followed  by \u05dc\u05b0 instead of the more common direct object. This does not generally seem to be because the texts concerned are late (GK \u00a7117n), though the substitution of \u05dc\u05b0 for \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be in 1\u00a0Chron 18:6 (cf. 2\u00a0Sam 8:6) could be explained in this way. More likely the variation is related to the use of \u05dc\u05b0 with Hiphils of some intransitive verbs, where it has been suggested that the expression is \u2018properly (as it seems) a dat. commodi\u2009\u2019 (BDB, 511). Alternatively (or additionally), one might associate it with the exceptional frequency of nouns cognate with \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 (such as \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 and \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4), which is a distinctive feature of \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 among the words for \u2018deliverance\u2019: the verb may in these cases have been thought of as a kind of denominative equivalent to \u2018bring \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2/ \u05d9\u05b0\ufb2a\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 to a person or group (see further  7.\u00a0Conclusion). A special group is constituted by instances where the subject of the verb is \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3 (or a similar word like \u05d6\u05b0\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b7 or \u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05df) with a pronominal suffix and the \u2018beneficiary\u2019 is denoted by \u05dc\u05b0 with the same suffix. The meaning is thus reflexive: someone\u2019s own \u2018hand\u2019 brings him the success or victory denoted by \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiph. A sequence of examples occurs in 1 Sam 25:26, 31 (where many commentators insert \u05d9\u05d3 before \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 with LXX) and 33, in the dialogue between Abigail and David about how David is to respond to Nabal\u2019s insults (vv. 10-11). The fact that in all three places the phrase is associated with incurring bloodguilt could be taken as evidence, in isolation, that it means specifically a judicial misdeed (so Sawyer 1982: 1049, 1052 [1990: 454, 457]). But this is improbable in the light of the full range of occurrences of this idiom, especially those in which it is applied to God in a wholly positive sense (Is 59:16; 63:5 and probably Ps 98:1). The data were assembled already by Driver (1890: 200-02), who concluded that \u05d9\u05d3 (and its synonyms) referred to the use of one\u2019s own power (\u2018force\u2019) to achieve one\u2019s aims. When God does this, it redounds to his glory. But human beings must, in a widespread biblical view, rely on God to help them, for they cannot succeed on their own. Using one\u2019s own human power is therefore viewed negatively (so also in Judg 7:2; Ps 44:4 and Job 40:14). Two clear occurrences of the idiom at Qumran fit well into this picture. CD 9:9-10 (the duplicate 4Q267 i 4-5 preserves a few letters of the context) cites 1\u00a0Sam 25:26 freely as the basis for not using force to make someone swear an oath; 1QS 6:27 uses the phrase of aggressive, arrogant behaviour towards a more senior member of the community (cf. 6:10-11). In neither case does it have a specifically legal character. The same idiom may also have been present in 4Q380 1 ii 4 and 4Q417 22:2.</p> <p>A.5  Appeals to one\u2019s ally on the basis of a treaty imply that \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 may in these instances have a meaning of providing assistance (e.g. Josh 10:6; 2\u00a0Sam 10:11\u201312).</p> <p>A.6  In Wisdom literature the verb only appears twice in Proverbs and four times in Job. In Proverbs it denotes the assistance provided by God (Prov 20:22) against one\u2019s enemy (cf. A.5) and the prolonged state of well-being given to those who follow the way of God (Prov 28:18). In Job it is three times used of saving the weak (Job 5:15; 22:29; 26:2) and once used of winning victory (Job 40:14).</p> <p>A.7  The verb is most frequent in Isaiah of all the Prophets. In the Prophets the verb often denotes in oracles of salvation God\u2019s future deliverance from the Exile (e.g.Isa 49:25; Jer 30:7; cf. acts of history in A.2). It often seems to be a call for help when in danger (Isa 37:20) or for healing from sickness (e.g. of Hezekiah at Isa 38:20).</p> <p> A.8  \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 appears most frequently in the book of Psalms (57x) in addition to 13 psalm-like passages elsewhere in the OT (for the latter see Sawyer 1082: 1055 [1990: 459]).  The occurrences in the Psalms relate to all the varied kinds of situation that have already been mentioned: deliverance in past history (Pss 44:4 [cf. vv. 2-3]; 98:1; 106:8, 10, 21; 107:13, 19), war (18:4, 28, 42; 20:7, 10; 33:16; 44:7-8; 60:7=108:7;  76:10 [cf. vv. 6-7]; 80:4, 8, 20), legal disputes (7:2, 11; 69:2; 71:3 [cf. v. 13]; 109:26, 31), future deliverance of Zion/Israel (69:36; 106:47), the support of the needy (17:7; 34:19; 72:4, 13; 76:10), the righteous and devout (7:11; 37:40; 86:2, 16; 145:19) and the king (18:4; 20:7, 10), as well as intervention in times of a breakdown in society (12:2; 36:7), protection in undefined circumstances against personal \u2018enemies\u2019 (3:8; 22:22; 28:9; 31:3, 17; 54:3; 57:4; 86:2, 16) and sickness (107:19; perhaps 6:5). Here especially the generality of the word is very evident. Most often it presupposes a situation of distress, but it is accompanied by \u05de\u05df in only about one-fifth of its occurrences and the military uses do not all arise out of the danger of defeat (note 118:28, with the parallel \u05e6\u05dc\u05d7, \u2018succeed\u2019). \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiph. overlaps with \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 in the breadth of its usage (and they are associated in 109:26 [cf. Josh 10:6; Isa 63:5; Job 26:2]), but they are complementary rather than synonymous: \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 is more focused on the relational aspect of the action, while its effect and result is more prominent in \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiph., whether it refers to deliverance or the bestowal of success and victory. The subject in the great majority of cases is God and his wonderful, mighty power is sometimes explicitly mentioned (98:1; 106:21). But so is his \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3, \u2018loyalty\u2019, in associated prepositional phrases (6:5; 31:17; 109:26: cf. 57:4), as are related words like \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4, \u2018righteousness\u2019 (71:2), and \ufb2a\u05dd, \u2018name\u2019 (54:3; 106:8). The most distinctive feature of the use of \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiph. here is the high frequency of the imperative, often in its emphatic form, in the appeals to God which are so characteristic of the numerous laments in the Psalter (3:8; 6:5: over twenty times in all).</p> <p>A.9  In expressing God\u2019s action to his people by \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 Niphal the Lord is described as \u2018shield of your help\u2019 (Deut 33:29), which is interesting considering the use of the noun \u05d9\u05b5\ufb2a\u05b7\u05e2 with such expressions.</p> <p>A.10  At Qumran \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 appears three times in the War Scroll, reflecting perhaps the biblical usage in military contexts (A.2), and four times in the Temple Scroll, mainly in historical references. These also appear elsewhere (CD 5:19; 4Q372 1:16; 4Q385a 18 ii 10; 4Q389 1 ii 3). The reuse of the idiom discussed in A.4 suggests its continued use in everyday speech, but \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiph. is not a prominent expression of contemporary prayer or liturgy: there is only one secure occurrence in 1QHa and three more in other texts (4Q380 1 ii 4; 4Q381 31:2; 4Q511 10:9). The contrast with the biblical psalms could not be greater, and perhaps reflects its infrequency in LBH and as a loan-word in Aramaic other than Samaritan Aramaic (Sawyer 1975: 80). But the seven occurrences preserved in the Heb. of Sirach (if 13:6 is included) give a rather different impression, especially when compared with the rarity of \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 hiph. in the biblical wisdom literature.</p> <p>B.1  Whilst \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 can be found in forensic contexts in the Hebrew Bible (see A.3 above), its origin as a forensic term, later developing from this technical to a non-technical sense, as advocated by Sawyer (1972: 94-95; 1975: 80), is uncertain. Scepticism regarding this origin was first expressed in 1970 by participants at the conference where Sawyer presented his findings (recorded in Sawyer 1975:83\u201384), and Sawyer himself admits that the question must remain open until a wider range of contexts is available (1975: 80). The main pieces of evidence marshalled by him are:</p> <ul> <li>a) its use in forensic situations in the Bible (see A.3 above);</li> <li>b) a forensic origin explains the use of \u05de\u05d5\u05b9\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 (e.g. at Deut 22:27), if it means originally \u2018counsel for the defence\u2019 (see Sawyer 1965; B.2);</li> <li>c) the verb\u2019s parallelism with other words that may denote legal terms (see Lexical/Semantic Fields\u00a0A.2);</li> <li>d) the appearance of legal terms in proper names in Semitic languages.</li> </ul> <p>The last of these is the weakest. For a) the evidence can be interpreted in either direction. It may have had a non-technical sense and developed its use to include the technical sense, especially since the cases of parallelism (c) are not conclusive. Likewise, (b) the meaning of \u05de\u05d5\u05b9\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7, as well as not denoting exclusively a \u2018counsel for the defence\u2019 in synchronic Hebrew, could have derived from the technical sense of the verb after the latter had itself developed from the non-technical sense.</p> <p>B.2  In his study of \u05de\u05d5\u05b9\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 Sawyer is careful not to read too much into one word (1965: 486), but expresses conviction that the evidence points to his interpretation. He sees the form \u05de\u05d5\u05b9\ufb2a\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7 (which he takes to be a noun; see Formal Characteristics\u00a0B.1) as denoting a specific legal office of \u2018advocate\u2019 or \u2018witness for the defence\u2019, for which there is no other word in Hebrew but there would have been a need for one.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"words/to_save%2C_help/#7-conclusion","title":"7. Conclusion","text":"<p>A.1  It now appears that the root may not be related to the Arabic \u2018to be spacious\u2019, and that little semantic evidence can be gained from tracing the verbal root. The frequency of the root in personal names may suggest that it is a verb used of God, but that much may already be derived from the Hebrew evidence.</p> <p>A.2  \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 denotes the bringing of assistance to someone in need, whether in military, civil or judicial contexts. It may also denote the actual saving of someone in battle or in history in general. From this a meaning of being in a prosperous state appears to have developed (especially in Wisdom literature).</p> <p>A.3  On a few occasions \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 might denote the provision of defence from enemies.</p> <p>A.4  In its breadth of application \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 is particularly close to \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b7\u05e8 among the words for deliverance and as a result the translation \u2018help\u2019 has sometimes been preferred (compare Exegesis\u00a0A.8). But \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 also remains close to other words in the group such as \u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc, as the (moderate) frequency of its use with \u05de\u05df attests, hence the continuing popularity of the rendering \u2018save\u2019 (and compare the Versions). The following account may clarify the synchronic relationship, whether or not its possible diachronic implications (for which there is no proof) are valid. In the Exegesis section of the entry for \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b7\u05e8 (A.3) it is suggested that its use in the majority of its biblical occurrences (especially in the Psalms) for \u2018help\u2019 where deliverance was involved led to its occasional association with \u05de\u05df like other members of the group. With \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 there seems to be an extension in the opposite direction. One might envisage a continuum of human experience extending from distress at one pole to equilibrium at the centre and to victory and success at the other pole. \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 like other members of the \u2018deliverance\u2019 group mainly represents a movement from the negative pole to equilibrium, but it was natural for it also to be applied to the movement in the same \u2018direction\u2019 from equilibrium to the positive pole of success and victory. As such it came to occupy the original domain of \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b7\u05e8, \u2018help\u2019, as well.</p> <p>A.5  It has also been suggested above  (Exegesis\u00a0A.8) that, while \u05e2\u05b8\u05d6\u05b7\u05e8 refers to the action done in its relational aspect, \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 refers to its effect or result.</p> <p>B.1  Although Sawyer has argued that the origin of \u05d9\ufb2a\u05e2 lies in forensic contexts, the evidence is inconclusive. It is perhaps better to consider the synchronic evidence more than the diachronic.</p>"},{"location":"words/to_save%2C_help/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>For the abbreviations see the  List of Abbreviations.</p>  Abou-Assaf 1982    Ali Abou-Assaf,  et al.
