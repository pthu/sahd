A.1
Many weights inscribed with the wordעקב have been found;2 whereas one
weight was found with only theב and one with probably the lettersעק(letters not
clear on the photograph).3 See section 6.4. Archaeology.
1. Root and Comparative Material
A.1 The wordעַקֶבּ is derived fromעקב,‘to cleave’, ‘to split’,4 which has, apart from
עַקֶבּ, a few derivatives: * ַעיִקְבּ,‘breach’, ‘rubble’, andהָעְקִבּ,‘valley’. The latter word
is used in a number of locative or topographical names:ןֶואָתַעְקִבּ(Amos 1:5);תַעְקִבּ
וֹחֵרְי(Deut 34:3), etc.
2עַקֶבּ beka (a half shekel)
A.2 The nounעַקֶבּ is not attested in the cognate languages.5 However, the rootעקב
is attested in, for example, Ug. bq ʿ, ‘to split, open’,6 Moab. bq ʿ, ‘to break through
(of dawn)’,7 LMHebr.עקב,‘to split, chop’.8
A.3 The BHebr. wordעַקֶבּ,‘weight, coin’, is used in a quotation from Exod 38:26
in the midrashim, such as Bereshit Rabba (84:18):9םיִרְשֶׂעְבּלֵחָרלֶשׁהָּנְבּםֶתְּרַכְמםֶתַּא
תֶלֹגְּלֻגַּלעַקֶבּ:(וכ,חלתומש)ביִתְכִדאוּהאָדֲה,תֶלֹגְּלֻגַּלעַקֶבּוֹעיִגַּמדָחֶאְודָחֶאלָכּהֶיְהִיךְָכיִפְל,ףֶסָכּ
.לֶקֶשַּׁהתיִצֲחַמ,‘You sold Rachel’s son for twenty pieces of silver, therefore shall each
of you bring a beka a head; thus it is written (Exod 38:26): A beka a head, half a
shekel.’10
2. Formal Characteristics
A.1עַקֶבּ is a qatl formation – the most common noun pattern (almost a quarter of
all nouns)11 – of the root tertiae gutturalis √עקב.12
3. Syntagmatics
A.1 In the Hebrew Bibleעַקֶבּ occurs twice in the singular absolute. No other forms
are attested. In epigraphical sources the word is solely used as the designation of
the weight on which it is inscribed.
A.2עַקֶבּ occurs in a nominal clause:
וֹלָקְשִׁמעַקֶבּ,‘a beka is its weight’, Gen 24:22;
תֶלֹגְּלֻגַּלעַקֶבּ…הָדֵעָהיֵדוּקְפּףֶסֶכְו,‘the silver of the counted ones of the congregation was
… a beka per head’, Exod 38:25–26.13
A.3עַקֶבּ occurs in apposition:
לֶקֶשַּׁהתיִצֲחַמ…עַקֶבּ,‘a beka … half a shekel’, Exod 38:26.14
4. Ancient Versions
a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions:
δραχμὴ, ‘drachma (weight)’:15 Gen 24:22lxx; Exod 39:3lxx (38:26mt);
δίδραχμον, ‘coin of two drachmas’:16 Exod 39:3αʹ (38:26mt).
b. Targumim (t: o/n/psj/smr):
ןומכרד,‘drachma’:17 Gen 24:22psj; Exod 38:26psj;
יבט/עבט,‘half-shekel, coin’:18 Gen 24:22n,smr; Exod 38:26smr;
אלקת,‘shekel’:19 Gen 24:22o; Exod 38:26o;
No rendering: Exod 38:26n.20
c. Peshitta (S):
������ (maṯqālā), ‘weight, scale, shekel’:21 Gen 24:22; Exod 38:26.
עַקֶבּ beka (a half shekel)
3
d. Vulgate (V)
siclos duos, ‘two shekel’:22 Gen 24:22.
No rendering: Exod 38:26.23
5. Lexical/Semantic Fields
A.1עַקֶבּ occurs in the context of the description of the weight of gold (בָהָז, Gen
24:22) and silver (ףֶסֶכּ, Exod 38:25–26). Another weight mentioned in its context
is the shekel (→לֶקֶשׁ). The beka is even equated with a half shekel in Exod 38:26.
This use seems to agree with the custom of expressing the worth of precious goods
in terms of weight, whereas food was described on the basis of size or volume.24
6. Exegesis
6.1
Literal Use
A.1 The wordעַקֶבּ has the basic meaning ‘split off’, ‘piece’, ‘part’,25 and in Exod
38:26 it is a ‘part’ (from two parts) of a shekel.26
A.2 The designationעַקֶבּ is mentioned as a weight in Gen 24:22: Abraham’s servant
gives rich gifts to Rebeccah. He takes (חקל) a golden ring (בָהָזםֶזֶנ), whose weight
(לָקְשִׁמ) is aעַקֶבּ, as well as two bracelets, which weigh ten golden shekels (בָהָזהָרָשֲׂע;
cf. →לֶקֶשׁ). The use ofעַקֶבּ for a ring, next to ‘ten shekels’ for bracelets, suggests
that a beka weighs only part of a shekel.
A.3 In Exod 38:26 aעַקֶבּ is mentioned in the context of silver (ףֶסֶכּ, Exod 38:25) as
processed material (Exod 38:24-31) in the manufacture of the tabernacle, and was
gathered in a census. This is referred to as aעַקֶבּ in silver per head for every one
who was numbered in the census from the age of twenty and upwards. Aעַקֶבּ is
further referred to in Exod 38:26 as half a shekel (לֶקֶשַּׁהתיִצֲחַמ,‘half of a shekel’) ‘by
the sanctuary shekel’ (שֶׁדֹקַּהלֶקֶשְׁבּ,→לֶקֶשׁ).
6.2
Figurative Use
Not attested.
6.3
Pictorial Material
A.1
Some pictures or drawings of beka weights have been published.27
Two of
these are presented below (Figs. 1–2), of which the round, stone weight is the most
common example.

Figure 2: Metal beka-weight29
A.2 A First Temple period beka weight was discovered during the sifting project
of archaeological soil originating from the Western Wall foundations in the Emek
Tzurim National Park under auspices of the City of David Foundation. The find
is interesting, because the weight was inscribed in mirror script (see Fig. 3, below),
which suggests that the craftsman was used to create seals and to writing in mirror
script.30

6.4
Archaeology
A.1
Kletter mentions thirty-five weights designated with the lettersב,ק, andע
(or one or two of these letters) as aעַקֶבּ.32 Their provenance is, as far as is known,
for the most part in Judah. They date from the late 8th century BCE, and later
centuries and vary in weight from 5.51 to about 6.90 grams, with an average of 6,003
grams.33 These weights, all homogeneous in shape, are as a rule made of stone as
all weights were,34 although a metal weight has been found.35 It is also possible to
point out a number of uninscribed beka weights (6.0-6.6 grams, mostly of stone),
of which it is difficult to say whether they date from the same or from an earlier
period.36

7. Conclusion
A.1 Theעַקֶבּ,’half shekel’, is part of a system of weights that is based on theלֶקֶשׁ.
The fact that the found beka weights vary in weight, is attributed to the existence
of more than one weight standard.37 However, it can also be explained by factors
such as mistakes in the manufacture of the weights, inability to weigh accurately,
and to wear and tear.38 Since the found beka weights originate from the same period
and, as far as is known, come largely from the same area (Judaea), and are largely
homogeneous in terms of material and shape, it is probable that these weights are
based on the same standard of weight.39 It is therefore likely that the same weight
standard is to be applied to theעַקֶבּ of Gen 24:22 and the one of Exod 38:26. It is
true that for theעַקֶבּ of Exod 38:26, unlike that of Gen 24:22, the standard of the
‘sanctuary shekel’ applies. But the question remains whether this standard set by
the sanctuary would have deviated from the standard that was in normal use (see
→לֶקֶשׁ).

‘half-shekel’, which suggests that δίδραχμον equals ‘half-shekel’. Apparently ‘half-shekel’ was
intended as a definition for one drachma, because a δίδραχμον equals always a shekel (see Gen
23:15, 16; Exod 21:32).

Powell 1992: 907.
Heltzer 1998: 44*-46*, argues for 6.82gr as the weight of a Judaean half-shekel, whereas
most studies assume the average weight in line with Kletter’s observations. In this respect
the comment by Marvin Powell (Powell 1992: 905) should be kept inmind: ‘Most surviving
weight specimens are small and deviation from a given norm increases as the size of the weight
decreases.’ Similarly Weippert 1977: 93.
