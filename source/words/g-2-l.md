## Introduction

Grammatical Type: vb <i>qal</i> and <i>niph.</i>  
Occurrences: 103x[^1] HB (qal: 28/31/36; <i>niph.</i>: 7/1/0); 1(2?)x Sir; 16x Qum; 1(?)x inscr. (Total: 120 [121/122?]).

### Text Doubtful

<b>A.1</b>  Sir 37:19 mss B and C have the <i>qal</i> part. גואל but Bmg and D have יאל
<i>niph.</i>, as follows: 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">יש חכם לרבים נחכם ולנפשו הוא נואל</span>,
 ‘a person may be
wise and be a source of wisdom to many, yet for himself be foolish’,
which may make better sense. This can be explained simply by mss B and C
misreading נ as ג and could be supported by ἄχρηστος in the LXX,
although the first part of the verse is different, and similarly by 
ܣܟܠܐ
(<i>sklʾ</i>), `fool(ish)' in Pesh. The Vg is different again: <i>vir peritus multos
erudivit et animae suae suavis est</i> (reading נאוה? Cf. Song 6:3),
although there are variant readings, <i>insuavis</i> and <i>inutilis</i>. which
align themselves more with the LXX.

<b>A.2</b>  Qumran:  

<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: -0px;">
<b>a)</b> CD 14:16 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">ג[ואל]</span> seems likely and is supported by the
parallel passage in 4Q266 10:9.  </div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: -0px;">
<b>b)</b> 4Q168 1:4 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">[יגא]לך</span> seems to be a citation of Mic 4:10 where 
יהוה 
is the subject.  </div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: -0px;">
<b>c)</b> 4Q284a 1:7
is a passage on harvesting and it is unclear whether גאל
means ‘redeem’ or ‘defile’. Abegg, Bowley, and Cook (2003) list this
passage under גאל (I) ‘redeem’, which is supported by García Martínez and
Tigchelaar who translate the verse as ‘He may not redeem them with
[...]’ (<i>DSS.SE</i>, 641). The direct object is also unclear, due to
missing text, but could be figs (התאנים from line 4). DJD xxxv:132
argues that the passage describes olive-pressing and the extraction of
olive oil: ‘let him b[y] no [mean]s defile them by opening them before
he pours [them into the press].’ The argument is dependent to a large
extent on the analysis of the previous lines, which are also unclear.
But the context of this passage does support the idea of purity and the issue of insiders and outsiders, which would suggest that this is not a case of ‘redeem’.  </div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: -0px;">  
<b>d)</b> 4Q420 1a ii-v 6 
seems to be a <i>niph.</i> 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">נגא[ל ...]</span>
occurring with צדק ‘by
righteousness he is redeemed’, the subject being נאמן ‘one who is
reliable’. From the context this seems likely.    </div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: -0px;">
<b>e)</b> 4Q504 22:3 
is another case where the meaning is indeterminate: ...]<span dir="rtl" lang="he">אשר גאלה</span>\[...,
‘who redeems/defiles her’ (DJD vii:166). Both the ה and the ל are
also partially effaced.  </div>


<b>A.3</b>  It is interesting to note that in Sir 51:12(e) Geniza ms B has an
instance of <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל ישראל</span>,
‘redeemer of Israel’. Although the passage of
which it forms part is not in the Greek, it may nevertheless be ancient
(cf. Skehan and Di Lella 1987:569-570).


<b>A.4</b><a id="uncertain"></a> Frank M. Cross read <span dir="rtl" lang="he">וגאלתי ירשלם</span>, ‘and I will redeem Jerusalem’, in
l:2 of Inscription A from Khirbet Beit Lei (Cross 1970:299-302), but a
number of scholars read this line differently (see <i>AHI-1</i>, 15.005:2,
15.006:2; <i>HAE</i>, 242-246 [BLay (7):1]).

Qere/Ketiv: none

## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<a id="RootComparative-A1"></a>
<b>A.1</b>  In the OT גאל is attested in the <i>qal</i> 95x. Of these instances, almost half are the active participle as a substantive, twelve of which occur as 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גֹּאֵל הַדָּם</span>, 
‘avenger of blood'. גאל is also attested in the <i>niph</i>.
(8x). The nouns <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גְּאֻלָּה</span> 
(14x) and <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גְּאוּלִים</span>
(1x) are cognate. There
are 3 occurrences of a name in the HB that is probably
cognate, יִגְאָל (Num 13:7, 2 Sam 23:36, 1 Chron 3:22). A further
PN, גאליהו, which does not appear in the HB occurs 8 times in
pre-exilic Hebrew inscriptions (see <i>AHI-1</i>: 321, <i>AHI-2</i>: 149, for
references). There is also an uncertain occurrence of the verb in an
inscription from c. 700 (see
<a href="#uncertain">Introduction A.4</a>
above).


<b>A.2</b>  The root גאל is peculiar to Hebrew among the Semitic languages and
became a loan-word in Samaritan Aramaic and post-biblical Jewish Aramaic
(Stamm 1971:385).


<b>A.1</b>  גאל has a parallel in Babylonian 
<i>paṭāru</i> (‘to loose, release’), a
term used in Babylonian law for the duty or obligation to buy back lost
family property or enslaved people, but also used more generally for
buying slaves and prisoners (Stamm 1971:386). The Israelite concept of
‘redemption’ (buying back people or property in the legal sense) differs
from the Babylonian in respect of its basis in Israel’s relationship to
Yahweh. Since all land belongs to Yahweh, it is merely ‘on loan’ to the
people and they must therefore always retain the right to repurchase it
(Lev 25:23f.). In the same way, an Israelite must not remain a slave for
a long time (Lev 25:42) because he is a descendant of those whom Yahweh
freed from the Egyptians (Stamm 1971:386).


<b>B.1</b> It is generally agreed that גאל (I) is totally unrelated to its
homonym גאל (II) (<i>niph.</i>), meaning ‘to be (ritually) defiled’ (possibly a
by-form of <span dir="rtl" lang="he">געל</span>),[^2] 
<i>contra</i> Johnson, who suggests that in both words
there is the basic idea of ‘covering (up) an object’ (1953:72), the
first being ‘to protect’ by covering, and the second ‘to cover’ in the
sense of soiling.

‘and redeemed with rejoicing’; and in 4Q471a 3: גאלנו ‘he has redeemed
us’, although in both cases it is likely that the subject is יהוה.


<b>A.9</b> A number of times the <i>qal</i> act part. גֹּאֵל is used as a substantive
for both human (a–f) and divine (g–k) subjects:

<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>a)</b>  When a <i>human</i> גֹּאֵל is the subject, the following verbs occur with it: בוא, ‘to come’ (Lev 25:25); גאל ‘to redeem’ (Lev 25:25); היה, ‘to be’ (Lev 25:26); היה, [understood] (Num 5:8); מות <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to kill’ (Num 35:19[2x], 21); פגע, ‘to meet’ (Num 35:19, 21); מצא, ‘to find’ (Num 35:27); רצח, ‘to kill’ (Num 35:27); רדף ‘to pursue’ (Deut 19:6, Josh 20:5); עבר, ‘to pass by’ (Ruth 4:1); אמר, ‘to say’ (Ruth 4:6, 8);     שחת, pi. ‘to destroy’ (2 Sam 14:11, Ruth 4:6 <i>hiph.</i>);     יכל, ‘to be able’ (Ruth 4:6[2x]); סור, ‘to turn aside’ (Ruth 4:1); ישב, ‘to sit down’ (Ruth 4:1); רבה, <i>hiph.</i> ‘to multiply’ (2 Sam 14:11); שלף, ‘to take off’ (Ruth 4:8).

<b>A.1</b> λυτρόω (‘to release on receipt of ransom’, ‘redeem’, LSJ, 1067a) is
clearly the most frequently used verb to translate גאל in the LXX. It is
interesting to note that among the other Hebrew verbs translated by
λυτρόω and ῥύομαι (‘to set free, redeem, deliver’; ‘to protect’, LSJ,
694) are those defined by Sawyer as the semantic field of <span dir="rtl">הוֹשִׁיעַ</span>,
namely נצל (<i>hiph.</i>), חלץ (pi.), מלט (pi.), פלט (pi.), and פצה.


<b>A.2</b> ἀγχιστεύω (‘to be next-of-kin’, LSJ, 17a) is used in each of the
‘technical’ contexts of גֹּאֵל, for the duties of kinsman and the
avenger of blood, and is used exclusively for גאל.


<b>A.3</b> λυτρόω is used across the whole range of literature, bearing no
distinction between socio-legal, cultic or religious contexts. ῥύομαι,
however, is only used outside of the technical legal and cultic
contexts.


<b>A.4</b> It is interesting that there is a distinction made in the LXX, which
is not expressed in Hebrew, between the present part. ὁ ῥυόμενος (Gen
48:16; 59:20), with one example anticipating future deliverance, and the
aorist ὁ ῥυσάμενος (Isa 44:6; 47:4; 48:17; 49:7; 54:5, 8), which seems
to be a deliberate reference to past deliverance (i.e. the exodus).


<b>A.5</b> The Minor Versions (namely αʹ, σʹ, and θʹ) show a tendency (most
pronounced in αʹ and least so in σʹ, who has a range of equivalents) to
use ἀγχιστεύω(ν) or ἀγχιστεύς (the words used in Ruth for ‘kinsman’),
rather than λυτρόω or ῥύομαι, even for God. This accords with the aim of
Aquila’s revision of the LXX in particular to have a single equivalent
for each Hebrew word, but to achieve this it seems to have been
necessary in some contexts to stretch the meaning of the verb ἀγχιστεύω
beyond its usage elsewhere. It may also reflect a development in
Judaism, associating God more closely with the kinsman-redeemer figure,
thus emphasising the familial connection with his people. A similar
tendency can be seen in early Christianity, with references to God as
‘father’ and Paul’s emphasis on adoption into God’s family (cf. Rom
8:15, 9:4; Gal 4:5). σʹ (Isa 47:4; 49:7, 26) and θʹ (Isa 47:4) were
sometimes content to replace a more general expression with a word from
the λύτρον-group.


<b>A.6</b> גאל seems to be translated by words which have the idea of removing
from danger, e.g. ἐξαιρέω, whereas פדה seems to have a broader range of
meaning. It is translated by verbs which emphasise an exchange in the
ransom, e.g. ἀλλάσσω, ἀπολυτρόω, but it also shares the general sense of
liberation and rescue from danger, e.g. σῴζω.

* ܦܪܩ
(<i>prq</i>) <i>ithpe.</i>, ‘to be redeemed, liberated’: Lev 25:30, 49, 54; 27:20, 27, 28, 33; Isa 52:3.


<b>A.1</b> Although ܦܪܩ (<i>prq</i>) is the most common verb used to translate
    גאל
in the Peshitta, along with many others in the semantic field, there are some interesting variations which are worth noting.
    ܦܨܝ/ܦܨܐ
(<i>pṣʾ</i>/ <i>pṣy</i>) ‘to save, deliver’ is used to translate גאל on three occasions when it follows another ‘deliverance’ word (Ps 106:10; Jer 31:11; Hos 13:14) or another ‘legal’ term, e.g. ריב (Ps 119:154). However, this is not consistent (cf. Isa 49:26, 60:16, 63:9, etc.).

<b>A.2</b> In several instances where the other versions use another familial term, emphasising the relational aspect of גאל
(ἀγχιστεύω(ν), קריב, <i>propinquus</i>), the Peshitta uses ܩܪܝܒ (<i>qarrīḇ</i>), which can also mean ‘kinsman’ (Payne Smith, <i>CSD,</i> 519) (Lev 25:25<sup><small>1st</small></sup>; Num 5:8; 1Kg 16:11).

<b>A.3</b> The occurrences of גאל in Ruth are consistently translated by 
    ܬܒܥ
(<i>tbʿ</i>) ‘to seek, demand, require, claim, avenge’ (Ruth 3:13 [4x]; 4:4 [5x], 6 [4x], 8, 14; + ܥܝܪܬܐ (<i>ʿyārṯā</i>), ‘vengeance’ in
Ruth 2:20; 3:9, 12 [2x]; 4:1, 3) rather
than ܩܪܒ (<i>qrb</i>), which would perhaps seem more likely (cf. A.2 above). This is evidently based on the use of the same verb (with
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">ܥܝܪܬܐ</span>,
<i>ʿyārṯā</i>) to translate גֹּאֵל in the context of the avenging of blood
(<span dir="rtl" lang="he">הַדָּם</span>:
Num 35:12, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27; Deut 19:6, 12; Josh 20:3, 5, 9). 
    ܬܒܥ
(<i>tbʿ</i>) seems to carry with it something of the force of דרשׁ
in BHeb. (cf. Gen 42:22). It is interesting to compare
 ܬܒܥ ܥܝܪܬܐ ܕܕܡܐ
(<i>tbʿ ʿyārṯā daḏmā</i>) with the rendering by
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">תבע</span>/<span dir="rtl" lang="he">תבוע אדמא</span>
(Num 35:12, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27; Deut 19:6, 12) in Tg<sup><small>N</small></sup> and Tg<sup><small>PsJ</small></sup>.

<b>A.4</b><a id="Peshitta-A4"></a> The use of ܚܘܕܬܐ
(<i>ḥawdāṯā</i>, ‘renewal, restoration’) +
 ܕܡܐ 
(<i>dmā</i>, ‘blood’)
to translate
 גֹּאֵל הַדָּם
in 2 Sam 14:11 emphasises the restoration of blood required by the family, which is the right of the kinsman to claim.

<b>A.1</b> The predominant verb used by the Vg to translate גאל is <i>redimo</i> ‘to buy back, redeem’, although more general terms of liberation and rescue are also used (<i>eruo</i>, <i>libero</i>). It is interesting that the Vg consistently avoids using the familial term <i>propinquus</i> / <i>proximus</i> for God, preferring <i>redemptor</i>, with the remarkable exception of Prov 23:11. However, Jerome may have followed one of the Minor Versions here, which, as already noted above (LXX A.5), use ἀγχιστεύς of God in this verse.

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b> Verbs found in parallelism with גאל are קנה ‘buy/acquire’ (Ps 74:2) and פדה ‘to set free’ (Jer 31:11, Hos 13:14).

<b>A.2</b> A number of different verbs and phrases are associated with גאל:

<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">  
<b>a)</b> 
In Ruth 4:8 קנה, ‘to buy/acquire’ appears to take the place of <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גְּאַל־לְךָ אַתָּה אֶת־גְּאֻלָּתִי</span> in v. 6, when Naomi’s next-of-kin offers his right of redemption to Boaz (cf. also Ps 74:2 above). קנה
also corresponds to גאל in Exod 15:13, 16. פדה, ‘to ransom’ in Lev 27:27 is either being used synonymously with גאל or is a particular term for the redemption of first-born. 
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>b)</b> 
As one would expect, many other ‘deliverance’ words also occur in close proximity to גאל, namely פדה, ‘to set free’ (Ps 69:19), ישע (<i>hiph.</i>), ‘to defend, help’ (Ps 106:10, Isa 63:9), נצל (<i>hiph.</i>), ‘to deliver’ (Exod 6:6,
Mic 4:10, Sir 51:8, 11Q5 18:17).
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">  
<b>c)</b> 
In the context of the exodus rescue יצא (<i>hiph.</i>), ‘to bring out’ (Exod 6:6), נחה, ‘to lead’, and נהל, ‘to guide’ (Exod 15:13), also occur alongside גאל.  
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>d)</b> 
In socio-legal contexts, ריב, ‘to plead one’s cause’ (Ps 119:154, Lam 3:58) is closely related to גאל.  
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>e)</b> 
In passages concerning rescue from oppression, קרב, ‘to draw near’ (Ps 69:19), נחם (pi.), ‘to comfort’ (Isa 52:9),רחם ‘to have pity’ (4Q176 8-11:10) are all associated with גאל.  
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>f)</b> 
In a speech by <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יהוה</span>, גאל is in collocation with קרא, ‘to call’ (Isa
43:1).
</div>


<b>A.3</b> The nouns associated with גאל are רֵעֵהוּ, ‘his friends’ (1 Kgs 16:11), and גְּאוּלִים in apposition with עַם־הַקֹּדֶשׁ, ‘the holy people’ (Isa 62:12).


<b>A.4</b> The titles of God associated with גאל are <span dir="rtl" lang="he">קְדוֹשׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>, ‘the Holy
One of Israel’ (Isa 41:14; 43:14; 47:4; 48:17; 54:5; 4Q176 8-11:7); <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מֶלֶךְ־יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>, ‘the King of Israel’ (Isa 44:6; 47:4; Jer 50:34); <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יהוה צְבָאוֹת</span>, ‘the LORD of hosts’ (Isa 44:6; 47:4); <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יֹצֶרְךָ מִבֶּטֶן</span>, ‘the one who formed you from the womb’ (Isa 44:24), קְדוֹשׁוֹ, ‘his Holy One’ (Isa 49:7);  <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מוֹשִׁיעֵךְ</span>, ‘your saviour’ (Isa 49:26; 60:16), <span dir="rtl" lang="he">אֲבִיר יַעֲקֹב</span>, ‘mighty one of Jacob’ (Isa 49:26; 60:16), אָבִינוּ, ‘our father’ (Isa 63:16).


<b>A.5</b> Antonyms: מכר, ‘to sell’ occurs several times in both socio-legal (Lev 25:25 [2x], 33; Ruth 4:3) and cultic (Lev 27:20, 27, 28) contexts. גאל is used in contrast with מכר, which confirms the idea of גאל meaning to ‘purchase’ or ‘re-purchase’ something which has been sold. Surprisingly, perhaps, the same word also occurs once in a theological context, in Isa 52:3, where God says to Israel 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">חִנָּם נִמְכַּרְתֶּם וְלֹא בְכֶסֶף תִּגָּאֵלוּ</span>, ’for nothing you were sold and without money you shall be redeemed’. This seems to suggest that גאל usually involves a monetary transaction, but Israel’s case is an exception (see <a href="#Exegesis-A10">Exegesis A.10</a> below). In 4Q185 1-2:ii.10 (Wisdom literature) גאל is used in opposition to הרג, ‘to kill’ in a warning to those who hate wisdom,
comparing them to God’s people whom he will save. In 4Q251 14:2, part of the legal commentary based on Lev 27, קרב, ‘to bring near’ (i.e. present as an offering) is used in opposition to גאל in the context of cultic
sacrifice.

## 6. Exegesis

<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: -22px;">
<b>A.1 a)</b> גאל, ‘to re-purchase, reclaim’ (<i>qal</i> and <i>niph.</i>), in the particular context of cultic laws in Lev 27 (and related Qumran texts 4Q251 14:2; 4Q367 3:7), refers to the redemption of gifts to the sanctuary. The following may be re-claimed after one fifth has been added to their value: unclean animals not fit for sacrifice (v. 13), the first-born of an unclean animal (v. 27), a field which has been consecrated (v. 19), a house which has been consecrated (v. 15) or a tithe of the land which is the Lord’s (v. 31). However, a tithe of herds and flocks (v. 33) and a consecrated field which has either been sold or left un-redeemed by the original owner (v. 20) may not be redeemed. In addition, anything devoted to the ban (חרם) belongs exclusively to God and may not be redeemed (v. 28). In each case, the only person who is able to ‘re-claim’ an offering is the original owner.  
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>b)</b> There is an interesting clarification of Lev 27:13 in the legal commentary, Halakhah A (4Q251 14:2). Whereas the MT may be regarded as
ambiguous (superficially) as to whether (אִם) an unclean animal may be
offered for sacrifice, it is made quite clear in the Qumran text that it
must be redeemed (see DJD xxxv:42 and Levine 1989:195).
</div>   



<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: -22px;">
<b>A.2 a)</b>
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>, 
 ‘to reclaim as kinsman’ occurs in the Holiness Code (Lev 25) and in the narrative in Ruth 2-4. The adjective קרוב in Ruth 2:20, 3:12 places the emphasis on kinship, which is also reflected by the translations of the subst. part. <i>propinquus, proximus</i> (Vg), cf. Num 5:8 and 1 Kgs 16:11 (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">קריב</span> Tg<sup><small>J</small></sup>), where the subst. part. seems to mean little more than ‘relative’. It is in Ruth that we find instances of גאל (<i>qal</i>) with an intransitive sense ‘to act as one’s kinsman’ (BDB, 145) in the context of claiming property as inheritance. Since גֹּאֵל appears as a title for someone (e.g. Ruth 3:9, 12, etc.) the relational quality seems to assume priority over the verbal aspect of redemption and is thus the foundation for the subsequent action. It is the familial relationship that provides the basis for the obligation or right to claim or acquire property or people, either on behalf of one’s kin or by claiming the inheritance for oneself.
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>b)</b> 
The people who can act as גֹּאֵל for someone are listed in Lev 25:49: a man’s uncle, uncle’s son, or anyone left who is of his flesh in his family (i.e. blood-related). It is also possible for a man to be without a גֹּאֵל (Lev 25:26, Num 5:8, 4Q251 16:5, cf. CD IX 13-16 based on Num
5:8 which has בעל rather than גאל), but he may redeem himself (גאל <i>niph.</i>: Lev 25:49) if he has acquired the means to do so, <span dir="rtl" lang="he">כְּדֵי גְאֻלָּתוֹ</span>, (Lev 25:26).
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
<b>c)</b> In a passage about distribution of wealth the Damascus Document 4Q266 10:i.9 teaches that the community will provide for the [girl] who has no
גואל.
</div>

<b>A.3</b> גֹּאֵל הַדָּם is used several times (in the asylum laws in Num 35:19, 21, 24, 25, 27 [2x], and also in Deut 19:6, 12; Josh 20:3, 5, 9; 2 Sam 14:11) and is usually translated as ‘the avenger of blood’ (BDB, 145; NRSV). It seems, therefore, to some scholars, that another
responsibility or right of the kinsman is to restore the blood of the family which has been lost (Stamm 1971:386; Johnson 1953:68). This idea is emphasised particularly in Pesh 2 Sam 14:11 (see 
<a href="#Peshitta-A4">Peshitta A.4</a> above). 
Thus the avenger is the subject of verbs such as 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מות</span> <i>hiph.</i>, <span dir="rtl" lang="he">רצח</span> and <span dir="rtl" lang="he">רדף</span>. Tg<sup><small>N</small></sup> and Tg<sup><small>PsJ</small></sup>, translate it as <span dir="rtl" lang="he">תבע אדמא</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="he">תבע</span>, ‘to seek, demand, claim’, <i>DJPA</i><sup><small>1</small></sup>, 574b) and Pesh
translates it by 
<span dir="rtl">ܬܒܥ (ܥܝܪܬܐ)</span> (<i>tbʿ</i> [<i>ʿyārṯā</i>]), ‘seek (vengeance for)’. These both emphasise the concepts of family obligation and claiming
possession which are essential to גאל. When something belongs to someone they have a claim to it, either by themselves or with the help of one’s kinsman (גֹּאֵל).


<b>A.4</b> גאל (<i>qal</i> pf.), ‘to act as kinsman’ with God as subject, is used several times in the context of the exodus (Exod 6:6; 15:13; Isa 51:10; 63:9; Pss 74:2; 77:16; 78:35; 106:10; 4Q158 14i:5) and could be translated in several different ways. In Ps 74:2 גאל is in collocation with קנה, ‘to acquire/buy’ (obj. עדתך), which seems to have overtones of payment and is perhaps more akin to the human socio-legal usage of גאל (Lev 25). The same association of גאל with קנה occurs in otherwise identical expressions referring to early Israel in Exod 15:13 and 15:16. Even when payment is not mentioned, the use of גאל for buying someone out of slavery (Lev 25:48) may provide a useful background to the context here of release from slavery in Egypt. God fulfilled the role of Israel’s kinsman at the exodus, setting them free from slavery. גאל can easily take on the sense ‘to save’ or ‘liberate’ here, although this ignores the connotation of God ‘acquiring’ or ‘claiming’ his people, which may be underlying the choice of גאל rather than (or alongside) ישׁע <i>hiph.</i> or נצל <i>hiph.</i> This does not preclude, however, the possibility that the meaning of גאל could have developed by association with other salvation words.

The use of גאל to describe the king’s action towards the poor in Ps 72:14 needs special attention. It is the only use of the verb with a human subject which lies outside the cultic and socio-legal contexts, and with which the preposition מִן is connected (on Lev 25:33 see 
<a href="#Syntagmatics-A1b">Syntagmatics A.1.b</a>). Both these characteristics link Ps 72:14 with some of the occurrences of גאל where it has a divine subject (which is not surprising in view of the overlap of royal and divine characteristics in the Bible): e.g. Gen 48:16; Hos 13:14; Ps 103:4; Sir 51:8. The proximity
of less specific words in the salvation-group should also be noted (נצל <i>hiph.</i> and עזר in Ps 72:12, ישׁע <i>hiph.</i> in 72:13). The same questions as above arise about how far the semantic components of ‘kin’, ‘release from slavery’ and ‘payment’ may be alluded to here. In any case this occurrence of the wider meaning of גאל in a royal psalm (which is presumably pre-exilic) is evidence that it does not represent a late, exilic, development (see also A.11, A.12 and B.3).


<b>A.5</b> גאל seems to have a particular force in Deutero-Isaiah. The subst. part. גֹּאֵל is used as a title of God thirteen times. גֹּאֵל also occurs alongside other titles of God: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">קְדוֹשׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>, ‘the Holy One of Israel’; <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מֶלֶךְ־יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>, ‘the King of Israel’; <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יהוה צְבָאוֹת</span>, ‘the LORD of hosts’; קְדוֹשׁוֹ, ‘his Holy One’; מוֹשִׁיעֵךְ, ‘your saviour’; <span dir="rtl" lang="he">אֲבִיר יַעֲקֹב</span>, ‘mighty one of Jacob’. It occurs six times with the phrase 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">כֹּה אָמַר יהוה</span>, ‘thus says the Lord’ (Isa 43:1,14; 44:6,24; 48:17; 49:7), and six times on the lips of God in promises of help 41:14, of
redemption from sins (44:22), of triumph over enemies (49:26), of compassion (54:8). It is significant that the only instance of גֹּאֵל as nomen regens is with Israel (Isa 49:7) – God is exclusively Israel’s
גֹּאֵל.


<b>A.6</b> גאל <i>qal</i> is used in an eschatological hymn of praise (Isa 44:23, 48:20, 52:9), which suggests the author has made a connection between the first exodus, the first ‘redemption’ or liberation, and the hoped-for future redemption, as well as hopes for the second liberation from the Babylonian exile (cf. Stamm 1971:390).


<b>A.7</b> Several times God’s ‘redemption’ of Israel and his title ‘Redeemer’ are linked to creation (43:1, 44:6,24, 54:5) – since God created His people, Israel, they belong to him, and so he has the right to redeem them, or to claim them back (cf. Stamm 1971:391). In this context the <i>qal</i> pass. part. גאלים occurs in Isa 51:9-11. Verse 9 is an appeal to God as Creator of the world to rescue them. גאלים in v. 10 refers to those who were ‘saved’ at the Red Sea, and is followed by פדוים in v. 11, looking forward to ‘the redeemed of the Lord’ returning to Zion from the Babylonian exile.


<b>A.8</b> The occurrences of גאל in Trito-Isaiah have a similar meaning to those in Deutero-Isaiah, in the context of future deliverance (59:20, 60:16). It also occurs in conjunction with אָבִינוּ, ‘our father’, with
reference to the past.


<b>A.9</b> גאל occurs in several verses in a 
quasi-forensic context, which seem to be related to other socio-legal uses of גאל referring to the actions
of a kinsman, namely the responsibility to protect and help a family member in times of need, including in a court trial (e.g. Job 19:25). גאל is used of God four times with ריב, ‘to contend, conduct a (legal) case’ (BDB, 936) in Jer 50:3; Ps 119:154; Prov 23:11; and Lam 3:58. In each case ריב is used with its cognate noun, hence the NRSV rendering ‘to plead a cause’.

<a id="Exegesis-A10"></a>
<b>A.10</b> גאל <i>niph.</i>, ‘to be reclaimed’ in Isa 52:3 (cf. 4Q176 8-11:4) is set in response to the community lament in 51:9f. and is a promise of liberation, in preparation for a summons (52:11) to depart from captivity. The legal sense of גאל is being used figuratively here, in opposition to מכר, to mean ‘reclaim’ (cf. Lev 25). Since Israel was not ‘sold’ in a proper legal transaction to Babylon, no ransom price is due from God, their rightful owner, for their ‘redemption’. This usage of גאל seems to suggest that its meaning can ‘overlap’ between the socio-legal and theological spheres. Isa 52:3 is a clear case of sharing the meaning of the socio-legal context, but excluding the monetary exchange.


<b>A.11</b> The use of מִן with גאל aligns it more closely with other ‘deliverance’ words, e.g. נצל <i>hiph.</i>, מלט pi., and חלץ pi. This use of גאל does not seem to be a radical departure in meaning from its meaning in
references to the exodus, although it is slightly more developed (cf. use of מִן with גאל in a passage on the exodus in the Reworked Pentateuch, 4Q158 14:i.5). The understanding of God as kinsman, who claims Israel and bails them out in times of trouble, is not excluded
from the meaning of גאל with מִן e.g. Ps 106:10, where גאל seems to parallel ישׁע <i>hiph.</i> The other examples of גאל + מִן imply a sense of rescue from oppressive powers and threats to life for the people as a whole or individuals within it (Jer 31:11; Hos 13:14; Mic 4:10; Pss 72:14; 103:4; 107:2; 4Q381 24a+b.5; 11Q5 18:17).


<b>A.12</b> The use of מִן does perhaps suggest a physical or metaphorical removal from trouble, rather than a restoration to the original owner, although the idea of liberation from the hand or power (יַד / כַּף) of
enemies (in all but two instances above) seems to suggest a transference of ownership. Hos 13:14 is an early example of גאל and פדה being used with מִן (not later than 8th century BCE; see also B.3). This contradicts assumptions that the use of מִן with גאל was a later development.


<b>A.13</b> An unusual connection is made in 4QPseudo-Ezekiel between גאל and ברית in a speech by יהוה, declaring that he is the one who redeemed his people
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">לתת להם הברית</span>, which could either be rendered ‘in order to give them the covenant’ or ‘by giving them the covenant’. If one compares the language of Ezekiel 37:23-28. it seems that God will save (ישׁע <i>hiph.</i>, v. 23) his people in order that his ancient promises of ruler, land, covenant and temple may be fulfilled. If it is an instrumental use of 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">לְ</span>, it would be a rather surprising development that re-establishing covenant had become a vehicle of redemption.


<b>B.1</b> The role of a man’s גֹּאֵל has been understood by some scholars to be to restore balance and wholeness to his family.[^8] However, although this description fits with a number of examples (e.g. where something is ‘bought back’ for a family member) it seems to ignore the cases where גאל could mean pre-purchase rather than re-purchase (Ruth 4:3 and Jer 32:7), and also see below on <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גֹּאֵל הַדָּם</span>, where the underlying idea does not seem to be one of ‘Wiederherstellung’.

[^8]: Stamm 1971:386; Johnson 1953:70; Jepsen 1957:158.


<b>B.2</b> Job 3:5 seems to express the idea of גאל as ‘claiming back’. It is the only example of גאל being used with an abstract subject (‘gloom/darkness’) and some argue either that it is a unique usage of 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גאל</span>, or that it should be read as the homonym גאל (II)/ געל, ‘to soil/ defile’, which may fit better with the rest of the verse. This
would support Johnson’s argument for a single original root of both גאל (I) and גאל (II)/ געל, meaning ‘to cover’, which is supported by Pesh
<span dir="rtl">ܟܣܐ</span>/<span dir="rtl">ܟܣܝ</span>
(<i>ksʾ</i>/<i>ksy</i>) <i>pael</i>, ‘to cover, hide’, and Vg <i>obscurare</i>, ‘to hide, conceal, obscure’ which seems to contain the idea of ‘cover’ (cf. LXX ἐκλάβοι). However, Stamm points to a different
‘core meaning’ of גאל in the idea of something being restored to its rightful owner. He translates it: ‘einfordern sollen ihn Finsternis und Dunkel’ for the forces of darkness and chaos are older than the light
(cf. Gen 1:2) and therefore have a claim on his life (1971:390). This view seems to be supported by the previous verse and to be more akin to the idea expressed by <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גֹּאֵל הַדָּם</span> (similarly Blau 1956:244-45).


<b>B.3</b> Verses containing גאל with מִן ‘to rescue from slavery, adversity, death’ with God (or the king) as the subject have been treated by both Stamm (1971:392-93) and Jepsen (1957:161-62) as instances of גאל which are outside of the ‘normal’ usage, and show a semantic development away from its ‘original’ meaning (Gen 48:16; Jer 31:11; Hos 13:14; Mic 4:10; Pss 103:4; 106:10; 107:2, and one without מִן in Ps 69:19). The list unaccountably omits Ps 72:14. Even if one follows Stamm and Jepsen in
regarding this group as exhibiting a widening of the meaning of גאל from its original legal context, the development should not be regarded as post-exilic in origin, as a plausible case can be made for an earlier
date for three of the occurrences concerned. Ps 72 is a royal psalm (see above A.4), Gen 48:16 has generally been assigned to an older layer of the Jacob-narrative (traditionally E) rather than the Priestly layer,
and Hos 13:14 is part of a judgement oracle which there is no compelling reason to deny to the eighth-century prophet (cf. Davies 1992:285, 295). In Gen 48:16, which Ringgren (1977:353) considered to be ‘perhaps the oldest passage using the root <i>gʾl</i>’, גאל also seems to be an unusual choice for ‘rescuing’ or ‘liberating’ from harm, as this is the only occurrence of גאל in Genesis. However, since Jacob had no human 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גֹּאֵל</span> when he was in need, it was God who rescued him, both from his uncle (Gen 31) and from his brother (Gen 32-33). The emphasis
here seems to be on the familial relationship, but under different circumstances from those we find in Leviticus and Ruth. Jacob was not in debt and did not need ‘redeeming’ in the socio-legal sense, but rather needed rescuing from danger, or protecting from harm (cf. Johnson 1953:75-77). For גאל as an element of pre-exilic personal names, most of them explicitly theophoric, see <a href="#RootComparative-A1">Root and Comparative Material A.1</a> above.


## 7. Conclusion


<b>A.1</b> The meaning of גאל seems to comprise three ‘semantic components’:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) ‘to act (or fulfil one’s duty) as kinsman’;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) ‘buying’ (cf. the parallelism of גאל with קנה, and opposition with מכר) and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) ‘claiming ’.  
These appear variously in its different uses, as below.


<b>A.2</b> The socio-legal contexts of Lev 25, Ruth and Jer 32 make clear the connection between the responsibility of a kinsman and the acquisition or re-purchase of property, possessions or people, when one
of their family is in financial trouble. The kinsman’s actions effect a transfer of ownership, by claiming something back for its rightful owner.


<b>A.3</b> The particular cultic use of גאל in Lev 27, which is concerned with re-purchasing things dedicated to God, does not have the kinship aspect to its meaning, but is a development of a) and b), meaning ‘to buy back’ or ‘re-claim’ a gift, when the subject is the original owner of the offering.


<b>A.4</b> The particular use of גאל in a construct relationship with הַדָּם seems to bring out the idea of ‘claiming’, which is the responsibility of a kinsman, so that <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גֹּאֵל הַדָּם</span> could almost be translated ‘claimer of blood’, which is another development of (b).


<b>A.5</b> The use of גאל in references to the exodus and other cases where God is the subject in contexts of deliverance (individual and national), could equally be rendered by the general meaning ‘to act as kinsman’ (a)
or by a more particular meaning ‘to re-claim’ (b) e.g. from alien ownership or ‘to deliver’ (from trouble). It is often difficult and sometimes unnecessary to separate these meanings in individual contexts. The particular actions of God to help his people in a time of need are
understood from the perspective of his close ‘kin’ relationship with Israel (cf. juxtaposition of אָב with גאל in Isa 63:16), which is emphasized in Deutero- and Trito-Isaiah in relation to God as creator. The particular uses of גאל with ריב in legal contexts could mean ‘to defend’ or ‘to bail someone out’, understood within the general responsibilities of a kinsman.


<b>A.6</b> The uses of גאל with the preposition מִן seem to define its meaning more specifically as ‘to rescue from’, i.e. removal from threats of enemies, danger or death. Again, the idea of kin-relationship (a) is not
absent, even if not explicit. This usage of גאל with מִן also shows a parallel to other ‘salvation’ words.


<b>A.7</b> The use of the subst. act. part. גאל often functions as a title, used for both humans, meaning ‘nearest relative bearing the kinship responsibility’ (a) and for God, meaning ‘the closest kin to Israel’ and also ‘redeemer’ in the sense of ‘deliverer’ from slavery and oppression. Although גאל is never used intransitively with a divine subject, the
subst. active participle (without a subsequent verb), seems to draw out the intransitive sense of the verb and emphasises the fundamental relational aspect to this verb’s meaning.
