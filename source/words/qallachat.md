### Text Doubtful

<b>A.1</b> The critical apparatus of <i>BHS</i> does not express any doubt regarding the reading <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> in MT 1 Sam 2:14,
nor regarding the rest of the list of four vessels in that verse. There is, nevertheless, a problem with the text. MT, supported by Pesh, Tg, and Vg, attests four cooking utensils, 
<span dir="rtl">כִּיּוֹר</span>,
<span dir="rtl">דּוּד</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">קַּלַּחַת</span>, 
and <span dir="rtl">פָּרוּר</span>,
while LXX mentions only three utensils: λέβης, χαλκίον, and κύθρα.[^1] 
4QSam<small><sup>a</sup></small> (col. III line 4) represents 
only two vessels: <span dir="rtl">בסיר או בׄפ̊רור̊</span>, of which the first vessel (<span dir="rtl">סיר</span>) is not attested in MT. According to the editors of 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup> the reading of <span dir="rtl">סיר</span> attested in 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup> is certainly original, because the word λέβης, ‘cauldron’ (<i>GELS</i>, 427), in
LXX<sup><small>B,Ant</small></sup>  mostly represents Heb. <span dir="rtl">סיר</span>.[^2] 
In addition to 1 Sam 2:14, λέβης only once seems to be the counterpart of MT’s <span dir="rtl">כִּיּוֹר</span> in 1 Kgs 7:40 (3 Kgdms 7:26), which is textual critically uncertain because the text obviously contains <span dir="rtl">הַכִּיֹּרוֹת</span> erroneously for <span dir="rtl">הַסִּירוֹת</span> (cf. MT 1 Kgs 7:45 <span dir="rtl">וְאֶת־הַסִּירוֹת</span> / LXX 3 Kgdms 7:31 καὶ τοὺς λέβητας). 
On the other hand, λέβης also reflects <span dir="rtl">דּוּד</span>, the second utensil in MT’s list (cf. 2 Chr 35:13; 1 Esdr 1:13).[^3]   
A serious problem regarding the testimony of 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup> is the fact that the narrative sequence differs between MT and 4QSam<small><sup>a</sup></small>: MT’s vv. 13–14 are read as the sequel of 1 Sam 2:16 in 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup>. Due to the textual differences of this chapter in MT and 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup>, scholars differ with regard to the most original reading. Some tend to give priority to MT’s reading of four vessels, which number in their view decreased subsequently in LXX and 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup> (e.g., Rofé 2010; Dietrich 2010). Others give priority the reading of 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup> and suppose that the list of vessels gradually expanded during the course of transmission.[^4] 
However, because MT’s reading of <span dir="rtl">קַּלַּחַת</span> itself is not doubted and presupposed in all LXX retroversions,[^5] the reading  of our lemma is ascertained; cf. also
<a href="#AVA1">Ancient Versions A.1</a> below.

[^1]: LXX<small><sup>Ant</sup></small> has a different order of the three vessels, namely λέβης, χύθρα, and χαλκεῖον; see Fernandez Marcos and Busto Saiz 1989, PAGE. For differences in the number of cooking vessels in LXX, see Parry 2006:00.

<span id="RCM"></span>
## 1 Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> <i>Egyptian</i>: Thomas Lambdin and Maximilian Ellenbogen 	regard <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> as a loan from Egyptian <i>qrḥt</i>, ‘earthen pot’ 
(<i>WÄS</i>, Bd. 5, 62-3; Hannig, 864).[^9] 
James Hoch (<i>SWET</i>, 331-32), however, is of the opinion that Egyptian <i>krḥt</i>, a type of basket for grapes or flowers, as well as Coptic <i>calaht</i>, a pot (Crum, <i>CD</i> 813-14), are loans from the Canaanite word <i>qlḥt</i>. Hoch’s suggestion is unlikely, however, and the Coptic word is better derived from Egyptian <i>qrḥt</i>. The latter is a rather general term for earthen-ware (Vachala 1992:109–11), but the vessel could also be made of metals like silver, gold, or bronze. The Coptic word denotes a blackened cooking pot and serves as a rendering of κύθρα/χύτρα in 1 Sam 2:14 and Mic 3:3. An Egyptian goddess bearing the name <i>qrḥt</i> is attested, but it is unclear whether she had anything to do with the vessel.

[^9]: Lambdin 1953: 154; <i>FWOT</i>, 149; see also <i>HAL</i>, 1030; <i>HALOT</i> 1102.

<b>A.2</b> <i>Akkadian</i>: 
If <i>qlḥ(t)</i> was the original form, a 
further cognate might be the Assyrian vessel <i>qulliu</i>, plural <i>qulliātu</i>, a type of bowl or pot in which food was prepared and/or served. Sometimes it appears to be made of clay, but more often of bronze (<i>CAD</i> Q: 297-98; 
Salonen, <i>Hausgeräte</i>, 2:110-11). It is hardly a jar (cf. <i>AHw</i>, 
926: ‘ein Ton- od Bronzekrug’), in contrast to Heb. 
<span dir="rtl">קולית</span>, 
Syr. <i>qūlā</i>, <i>qūl<sup>e</sup>tā</i> 
and Arab. <i>qillah</i> which all 
denote a type of jar or pitcher, not a cooking pot.	

<b>A.3</b> <i>Ugaritic</i>: 
Another cognate appears to be Ugaritic <i>qlḫt</i>, attested in <i>KTU</i> 5.22:16. This is a list of seemingly unconnected words and names. Apparently the tablet is a scribal exercise. The circumstance that the 
preceding two entries have to do with the hand-mill and the following entry is <i>qmḫ</i>, ‘flour’, suggests that the pot was regularly used for recipes containing flour. However, the scribe was very inexperienced and often confused the <i>ḥ</i> that was dictated to him with <i>ḫ</i> (for example in <i>qmḫ</i> = <i>qmḥ</i>, cf. Dietrich, Loretz, and Sanmartín 1975:166). So it is possible that the original Ugaritic form was <i>qlḥt</i>, which in turn might suggest a connection with the Ugaritic divine name <i>qlḥ</i>.[^10] 

[^10]: De Moor 1970a:225; De Moor 1970b:317; for parallels, cf. Haas 1994:520-38). 

<b>A.4</b> Rabbinic Hebrew</i>: The occurrences of the word <span dir="rtl">קלחת</span> in bBer., 56b; bSanh., 110b; Num. R., XVIII.2 are all derived from  Mic 3:3 and 
do not help to elucidate the meaning of the word in Classical Hebrew. 
bB.Bat., 74a, however, compares the heat to which the 
<span dir="rtl">קלחת</span> is exposed to the fire of hell and seems to indicate that the meat was turned over and over in it (<span dir="rtl">הדר</span>) while searing. 

## 2. Formal Characteristic

<b>A.1</b> Feminine word with the <i>qattalat</i> form; see BL, 476–77, 476-77, §61yβ-aγ.

## 3. Syntagmatics 

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">קַּלַּחַת</span>, preceded by the preposition <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, ‘into’, is complement to the verb <span dir="rtl">נכה</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to thrust’, in 1 Sam 2:14.

<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">קַּלַּחַת</span> is <i>nomen rectum</i> of <span dir="rtl">בְּתוֹךְ</span>, ‘in (the midst of)’, in Mic 3:3. It is part of a nominal clause:
<span dir="rtl">וּכְבָשָׂר בְּתוֹךְ קַלָּחַת</span>, ‘and like meat in (the midst of) a caldron’. 


## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>Septuagint (LXX)</b> 
 
* χαλκίον (LXX), ‘copper cauldron’,[^21] or χύτρας (LXX<sup><small>Ant</small></sup>), ‘earthen pot’:[^22] 1 Sam 2:14; see A.1 below;
* χύτρας, ‘<i>earthen pot</i>: receptacle for meat’:[^23] Mic 3:3. 

[^21]: <i>LEH</i><sup><small>3</small></sup>, 659; <i>GELS</i>, 728.
[^22]: <i>LEH</i><sup><small>3</small></sup>, 359; <i>GELS</i>,  417, κύθρας is a spelling variant of χύτρας.
[^23]: <i>GELS</i>, 738; <i>LEH</i><sup><small>1</small></sup>, 521: ‘earthen pot’; <i>LEH</i><sup><small>3</small></sup>, 670: ‘earthen pot’; LSJ, 2013: ‘earthen pot, pipkin’.

<b>Peshitta (Pesh)</b> 

* <span dir="rtl">ܩܪܕܠܐ݁</span> (<i>qerd<sup>e</sup>lā</i>), ‘a large hanging pot</i>’:[^24] 1 Sam 2:14; 
* <span dir="rtl">ܩܕܪܐ</span> (<i>qedrā</i>), ‘a pot’:[^25] Mic 3:3.

[^24]: Payne Smith, <i>CSD</i>, 518; Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 1402: ‘pot’.
[^25]: Payne Smith, <i>CSD</i>, 491; Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 1321–22. The latter lexicon does not take <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> as the Hebrew counterpart but <span dir="rtl">סִּיר</span> from the preceding clause.

<b>A.1</b><a id="AVA1"></a> Establishing the correct Greek counterpart of <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> in MT 1 Sam 2:14 (LXX 1 Kgdms 2:14) is difficult. As mentioned before, MT has four cooking utensils:
<span dir="rtl">כִּיּוֹר</span>,
<span dir="rtl">דּוּד</span>,
<span dir="rtl">קַּלַּחַת</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl">פָּרוּר</span>.
LXX (supported by VL[^28]) has three cooking utensils: 
λέβης, χαλκίον, and κύθρα, while in
LXX<sup><small>Ant</small></sup> the order of these vessels is different, namely λέβης, χύθρα, and χαλκεῖον.[^29]  
The problem starts with the question for which Heb. word the Gr. word λέβης is the counterpart. This is important in view of the reading in 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup>, reading only two cooking utensils: <span dir="rtl">סיר</span> and <span dir="rtl">פרור</span> (see <a href="#TDA1">Text Doubtful A.1</a> above). Because λέβης, the first utensil in the LXX text, is used mostly as the counterpart of Heb. <span dir="rtl">סִיר</span>, scholars assume that the Heb. <i>Vorlage</i> of LXX read <span dir="rtl">סִיר</span> similarly to 4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup> instead of MT’s <span dir="rtl">כִּיּוֹר</span>. The latter reading <span dir="rtl">כִּיּוֹר</span> may orginally have been a defective reading <span dir="rtl">כִּיֹּר</span>, which was a misreading for <span dir="rtl">סִיר</span>. However, this is not completely conclusive because λέβης is also used as rendering of <span dir="rtl">דּוּד</span>, the second utensil in MT’s list (cf. 2 Chr 35:13; 1 Esdr 1:13). 
LXX’s λέβης thus equals 4QSam<sup><small>B</small></sup>’s <span dir="rtl">סיר</span>/MT’s <span dir="rtl">כִּיּוֹר</span> but also MT’s <span dir="rtl">דּוּד</span>, which may suggest that LXX had a comparable list of utensils in its Vorlage as MT and  condensed the list by using one rendering for the first two utensils.[^31]
If thus LXX’s first word λέβης is the possible eaquivalent of MT’s first and second word, than LXX’s second word, χαλκίον (or LXX<sup><small>Ant</small></sup>’s χύθρα), may be the renderring for MT’s <span dir="rtl">קַּלַּחַת</span>.   

[^28]: According to <i>Palimpsestus Vindobonensis</i>, reading <i></i>cf. Belsheim 1885:7. 
[^29]: See Fernandez Marcos and Busto Saiz 1989: PAGE. <i>LEH</i><sup><small>3</small></sup>, 659; <i>GELS</i>, 728, χαλκεῖον is a variant of χαλκίον, ‘bronze cauldron’.
[^30]: The occurence of the word <span dir="rtl">כִּיֹּרוֹת</span> (pl. of <span dir="rtl">כִּיּוֹר</span>( in 1 Kgs 7:40 is debated and may be a scribal error for <span dir="rtl">סִירוֹת</span>, see <i>BHS</i> Apparatus; MT is supported in this case by Tg; but partly also by Pesh, which has a double translation <span dir="rtl">ܠܩܢܐ ܘܩܕܣܐ</span>  (<i>lqnʾ wqdsʾ</i>) ‘basins and caldrons’, of which the first word equals in the preceding verses MT’s dir="rtl">סִירוֹת</span>. See further Mulder 1998:354–55.
[^31]: Condensation as translation technique in the LXX is described in, <i>inter alii</i>, Van der Vorm-Croughs 2014:187–200. This translation technique is also known from the Targumim. Smelik (1995:97) labelled this technique as ‘minimalising’.  



## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> occurs in a list of cooking vessels: 
<span dir="rtl">בַכִּיּוֹר אוֹ בַדּוּד אוֹ בַקַּלַּחַת אוֹ בַפָּרוּר</span>, ’into the pan, or the kettle, or <span dir="rtl">הַקַּלַּחַת</span>, or the pot’ in 1 Sam 2:14. 

<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> occurs in parallelism with <span dir="rtl">סִיר</span>, ‘kettle’, in Mic 3:3.

<b>A.3</b> In both occurrences (1 Sam 2:13–14; Mic 3:3) the <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> is used to prepare <span dir="rtl">בָּשָׂר</span>, ‘meat’.

## 6. Exegesis 

<b>A.1</b> All the renderings of the word <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> in lexica and more specific word studies are rather general. James Kelso (<i>CVOT</i>, 31, #76) shortly states that ‘the vessel is used for cooking a meat stew’, whereas Alexander Honeyman (1939:90) concludes that existing evidence is insufficient ‘to fix this cooking-vessel more nearly’. The word is rendered as ‘caldron’ (BDB, 886; <i>KBL</i> 839), ‘cauldron, pot [for cooking]’ (<i>DCH</i> vii:255; similarly <i>HALOT</i>, 1102); ‘<i>olla</i>, <i>lebes</i> carni coquenda’ (Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 1216); ‘Topf, Kessel’ (<i>GB</i>, 714; <i>KBL</i> 839; <i>HALAT</i>, 1030); ‘Kessel, Schüssel’ (<i>HCHAT</i>, 2:316); ‘Pfanne uä’ (<i>HAWAT</i>, 409); and as ‘puchero, olla’ (<i>DBHE</i>, 636; similarly <i>LHA</i>, 724).


### 6.1 Literal Use

<b>A.2</b> According to 1 Sam 2:13-14 the <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> was a vessel used in the sanctuary at 
Shiloh for preparing a sacrificial meal (<span dir="rtl">זֶבַח</span>). Presumably the priests, sons of Eli, had a right to take a share from the meat (<span dir="rtl">בָּשָׂר</span>). A servant of the priest would come along ‘when the meat was cooking’ 
(<span dir="rtl">כְּבַשֵּׁל הַבָּשָׂר</span>, v. 13) and would spear a chunk on behalf of the priest with his 
three-pronged fork (<span dir="rtl">ְהַמַּזְלֵג שְׁלֹשׁ־הַשִּׁנַּיִם</span>). He would thrust (<span dir="rtl">נכה</span> <i>hiph.</i>) the fork into the pan (<span dir="rtl">כִּיֹּור</span>), or kettle (<span dir="rtl">דּוּד</span>), or <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span>, or pot (<span dir="rtl">פָּּרוּר</span>) to bring up (<span dir="rtl">עלה</span> <i>hiph.</i>) the piece.   
Both the circumstance that the vessels mentioned were intended for preparing a communal festive meal and the use of a three-pronged fork suggest that all these vessels were fairly large and had a wide opening. 
The use of the verb <span dir="rtl">עלה</span> <i>hiph.</i> might suggest that they were all fairly deep. The material of which the vessel was made is not mentioned.

### 6.2 Figurative Use

<b>A.3</b>  Mic 3:2-3 accuses the leaders of Israel of tearing off the skin from the people (<span dir="rtl">פשׁט</span> <i>hiph.</i>), and their flesh (<span dir="rtl">שְׁאֵר</span>) from their bones, and even of eating the flesh of the people, and flaying their skin from them. Finally they ‘break their bones in pieces, and spread them out in a kettle (<span dir="rtl">בַּסִּיר</span>), like flesh (<span dir="rtl">כְבָשָׂר</span>) in a <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span>’. Obviously the prophet – probably Micah the Morashtite – does not accuse the leaders of cannibalism here. He compares their policy of dispossessing small farmers (cf. 2:1-2, 9), tearing off the clothes of peaceful passers-by (cf. 2:8, the same verb <span dir="rtl">פשׁט</span> <i>hiph.</i>) and misleading innocent people (3:4-11) with a butcher’s trade.[^30] 
Nothing here suggests that the <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> is a special cultic vessel. Again the material of which it was made remains unclear.   
The verb <span dir="rtl">פרשׂ</span>, ‘to spread out’, suggests a fairly wide vessel suitable for cooking chunks of meat approximately as long 
as pieces of bone. Apparently  <span dir="rtl">סִיר</span> was a similar vessel since both are ruled by the same verb in Mic 3:3. Since the <span dir="rtl">סִיר</span> is for cooking the bones whereas the <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> is for the meat, the latter might be a cooking pot of higher quality. The spreading out of 
the chunks suggests a fairly flat bottom.

[^30]: On cannibalism and the content of Mic 3:3, see De Moor 2020:172–74. 

### 6.3. Illustrations

<b>A.4</b> Despite the fact that some cooking vessels such as 
<span dir="rtl">סִיר</span>,
<span dir="rtl">דּוּד</span>,
and 
<span dir="rtl">פָּרוּר</span> could be identified with archaeological findings,[^39] 
it is impossible to provide an illustration of 
<span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span>.[^40] 
There is an abundance of cooking vessels from archaeological excations, which may give some ideas about the forms of such receptacles.[^41] 
Next to these archaeological findings, there are illustrations of cooking and baking activity in the ancient world. See, e.g., the following two small statues (see also Long 2009:280).

## 7 Conclusion

The textual evidence suggests that a <span dir="rtl">קַלַּחַת</span> is a fairly deep earthen or metal cooking pot with a rather wide opening. In this vessel chunks of meat were spread out on the flat or concave bottom, apparently for maximum exposure to the heat, thus probably for a first searing. This process also explains why people replaced the vessel by metal versions (Egypt, Assyria) if they could afford it. The association with flour in the Ugaritic text suggests that after the searing water was added for prolonged simmering (<span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span>) and that finally the broth was thickened with flour to obtain what we would call a stew. Therefore the best rendering might be ‘stewpot’.
