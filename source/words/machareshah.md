Grammatical type: noun fem.  
Occurrences:   3x HB (0/3/0); 0x Sir; 0x Qum; 0x Inscr.  (Total: 3)  

* Nebiim: 1 Sam 13:20 (2x), 21;
* Qumran: – (see <a href="#Qum">B.1</a> below).

<b> A.1</b> While the first occurrence of
<span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> in 1 Sam 13:20 (<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרַשְׁתּוֹ</span>, with <i>pataḥ</i> as the third vowel) is a form of 
\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>,
the second occurrence (<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁתוֹ</span>, with <i>ṣ<sup><small>e</small></sup>rē</i> as the third vowel)
<span id="seree"></span>
is a form of \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>.
The Masoretic vocalisation of 1 Sam 13:20-21 suggests that the second occurrence of 
<span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> 
is a form of the same noun as 
<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>
in 13:21.[^1]
Tg<sup><small>J</small></sup> supports the Masoretic vocalisation and translates the two forms with <i>ṣ<sup><small>e</small></sup>rē</i> by forms of the same noun
(<span dir="rtl">עוּשְׁפָּא</span>),
while it represents the single form with a <i>pataḥ</i> instead of the <i>ṣ<sup><small>e</small></sup>rē</i> with
a form of a different noun (<span dir="rtl">פְּרָשָׁא</span>). 
However, most of the ancient versions treat the first occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> 
in 13:20 and <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>
in 13:21 as forms of the same noun (see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>). 
The latter option becomes more attractive as soon as one notices that the series of 
agricultural implements in 13:20
(<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרַשְׁתּוֹ</span>,
<span dir="rtl">אֵתֹו</span>,
<span dir="rtl">קַרְדֻּמּוֹ</span>,
<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁתוֹ</span>)
partially corresponds to the series in 13:21
(<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>,
<span dir="rtl">אֵתִים</span>,
[<span dir="rtl">שְׁלֹשׁ קִלְּשׁוֹן</span>?,]
<span dir="rtl">קַרְדֻּמִּים</span>,
<span dir="rtl">דָּרְבָן</span>).
Consequently, the first occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> 
in 13:20 and <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>
in 13:21 are sometimes treated as forms of the same noun.[^2]

<b> A.2</b> 
<span id="Emend">Of course, </span>
the twofold occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span>
in a single series of utensils (1 Sam 13:20) has raised questions.
Since part of the utensils mentioned in 13:20 reoccur 
in the same order in 13:21 (<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁה</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁת</span>,
<span dir="rtl">אֵת</span>,
<span dir="rtl">קַרְדֹּם</span>),
the latter verse was sometimes used as a basis for emending the text of 13:20.
Julius Wellhausen (1871:84) assumed that the second <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span>,
the fourth item of the list in 13:20, originally corresponded to <span dir="rtl">הַדָּרְבָן</span>
at the end of  13:21. He pointed to the fact that the ancient Gk. and Syr. translations 
read forms of the same noun (LXX: δρέπανον, ‘sickle’; Pesh: ܡܣܣܐ, ‘ox goad’) where MT reads <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁתוֹ</span> (13:20) and <span dir="rtl">הַדָּרְבָן</span> (13:21). Wellhausen’s proposal to read <span dir="rtl">דָּרְבָנֹו</span> at the end of 13:20 was taken over by many others.[^3] <span id="Emend2">Other scholars, however, assumed that the reading τὸ δρέπανον αὐτου, ‘his sickle’, goes back to Heb. <span dir="rtl">חֶרְמֵשֹׁו</span>, since </span>
δρέπανον  represents Heb. <span dir="rtl">חֶרְמֵשׁ</span>,
‘sickle’, in Deut 16:9; 23:26 (= 23:25<sup><small>LXX</small></sup>). These scholars regarded the reading <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> as secondary.[^4]  
Dominique Barthélemy argued that there is insufficient reason to replace <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span>
by a different word on the basis of the readings of LXX and Pesh. The earliest translators seem to have experienced the same problems with the Hebrew
text as modern scholars. They translated the second occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> 
differently from the first. The translators of LXX and Pesh  decided to use a noun that they used also 
to render <span dir="rtl">הַדָּרְבָן</span>,
the last utensil mentioned in 13:21. 
Barthélemy maintained that the first and second <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> 
in 13:20 derive from two different nouns, \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>
and \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>.
The two nouns must have had different meanings, but neither the earliest translators nor modern scholars could retrieve exactly to what kind of sharp utensils 
the two terms initially referred.[^5] 
<i>DCH</i> shares Barthélemy’s suggestion that
the two occurrences of  <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> 
in 13:20 refer to two different agricultural utensils and translates them as ‘plough’ and ‘goad’, respectively.[^6]


<span id="Qum"><b> B.1</b>  </span>
The sectarian composition <i>Serekh ha-Yaḥad</i> (Community Rule, ca. 100 BCE) contains 
the following enigmatic phrase:
<span dir="rtl">כיא בסאון רשע מחרשו</span>.[^7] 
The passage describes the characteristics of those who may not enter the community of the faithful. 
Although the interpretation of the phrase is disputed, it is clear that <span dir="rtl">מחרשו</span>
is not an alternative form of  <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span>.[^8] 
It has been proposed to regard <span dir="rtl">מחרש</span> 
as a noun meaning ‘ploughing’.[^9] 
If <span dir="rtl">סאון</span>
is taken as equivalent to Aram. <span dir="rtl">סיין</span>/<span dir="rtl">סוון</span>,
‘mud’, the whole phrase can be taken  as a proverbial saying:  ‘For in the mud of wickedness (is) his ploughing.’[^10]  


##<span id="RCM">1. Root and Comparative Material</span>

<b> A.1</b> <i>Root</i>: 
Both \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> 
and \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> 
are commonly assumed to derive 
from <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, 
‘to plough, engrave’.[^11]
These nouns 
have some Semitic cognates denoting an agricultural implement, as will be shown below.
The Heb. verb <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>
stems from proto-Semitic <i>ḥrṯ</i>
and has cognates in Ug., Akk., and many other Semitic languages (see below).[^12] 
It must be distinguished 
from <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">ii</span>, 
‘to manufacture’,[^13] 
which stems from proto-Semitic <i>ḥrš</i>, just like Ug. <i>ḥrš</i>
and Phoenician
<i>ḥrš</i>, ‘craftsman, artisan’.[^14] 
Contrary to Heb. <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, 
‘to plough, engrave’, Heb. <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">ii</span>
refers to the work of the craftsman or artisan.
Stephen Cook (1994) supposed that \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> derives from <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, ‘to plough, engrave’,
but that \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> derives from <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">ii</span>, 
‘to manufacture’ (see <a href="#Cook">below</a>).
<span id="KollerRoot">Aaron Koller (2012:86-89) distinguished a third root, <i>ḫrś</i>/<span dir="rtl">חרשׂ</span>, ‘to scratch’, assuming that <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span> </span>
means only ‘to plough’, not ‘to engrave’ or ‘to scratch’. 
He regarded the form <span dir="rtl">חֲרוּשָׁה</span>, ‘scratched’, in Jer 17:1
as a form of this verb (with <span dir="rtl">ש</span> erroneously pointed as <i>šin</i> instead of <i>śin</i>; cf. <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶשׂ</span> in Job 2:8). 
Koller saw \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> as a derivative of <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, ‘to plough’,
but \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> as deriving from <span dir="rtl">חרשׂ</span>, ‘to scratch’ (see <a href="#Koller">below</a>).
However, note that in the Babylonian Talmud <span dir="rtl">מחרישה</span> denotes a ‘strigil’, an instrument for scraping the skin (see <a href="#strigil">below</a>).

<b> A.2</b> <span id="Akk"><i>Akkadian</i>:</span> 
The Heb. verb <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>
has a cognate in Akk. 
<i>erēšu</i>, which means ‘to seed by drilling seed into a furrow by means of a seeder-plow, to cultivate or plant (a field)’.[^15] 
Among the derivatives of this verb are
<i>mērešu</i> 
and <i>mēreštu</i>, which mean ‘cultivation’ or ‘cultivated land/field’.[^16] 
Derivatives relating to a utensil are not attested.


<span id="Ugar"><b>A.3</b> <i>Ugaritic</i>:</span> 
The Ug. cognate of Heb. <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> I 
is <i>ḥrṯ</i>, ‘to plough’.[^17] The Ug. noun <i>mḥrṯt</i> (<i>KTU</i> 1.6:IV.3, 14; 6.14:3)
is usually interpreted as 
‘ploughed field’.[^18] 
However, Oswald Loretz proposed to regard it as
a <i>nomen instrumenti</i> denoting the ploughshare or  the plough as a whole.[^19] 

<b> A.4</b> 
<i>Arabic</i>:
The Arab. verb <i>ḥaraṯa</i> is a cognate of Heb. <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>
and means ‘to plough, to cultivate’. The Arab. noun
<i>miḥrāṯ</i> designates a plough.[^20] 
In Old South Arabian, however,
<i>mḥrṯt</i> 
refers to ploughed, cultivated land.[^21] 

<b> A.5</b> 
<i>Ethiopic</i>:
The Eth. (Geʿez) verb <i>ḥarasa</i> is a cognate of Heb. <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>
and means ‘to plough’. The noun
<i>māḥras</i> is translated as ‘ploughshare’ or as ‘plough’.[^22] 

<b> A.6</b> <span id="Postbib"><i>Postbiblical Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic</i>: </span>
In the Mishnah, the Tosefta and the Talmudim, 
the word <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> 
is virtually always spelled with a <i>yod</i> as <i>mater lectionis</i>: <span dir="rtl">מחרישה</span>.
The term occurs ca. 70 times and denotes the  plough in its entirety.[^23]
Not surprisingly, the word occurs 
in a context relating to ploughing (<span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <i>qal</i>).[^24] 
The <span dir="rtl">מחרישה</span> 
is said to ‘shake’ (<span dir="rtl">זִעֲזֵע</span>, pilpel of <span dir="rtl">זוע</span>) 
clods of earth and stones.[^25] 
<span id="pledge">The implement is regarded as indispensable.[^26]
The expression <span dir="rtl">יתד של מחרישה</span>, literally ‘the <i>pin</i>  of
the plough’, denotes the sharp metal plough-point.[^27] The Tosefta refers to <span dir="rtl">יתדות המחרישה</span>, 
‘plough-points’, that were attached to the plough’s <span dir="rtl">חרב</span>, 
‘tail-piece, handle’.[^28] 
<span id="strigil">In the Bab. Talmud, the expression <span dir="rtl">מחרישה דכספא</span></span>
does not represent a plough, but a strigil made of <span dir="rtl">כספא</span>, ‘silver’.[^29] 
Such a strigil was used for scraping the skin; cf. the meaning ‘to engrave’ of the verb <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>.
In modern Hebrew the word <span dir="rtl">מחרישה</span> means ‘plough’.


##<span id="FC">2. Formal Characteristics</span>

<b> A.1</b>  \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>[^30]/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>[^31] 
is a <i>miqtal</i> form with a feminine termination (BL, 490 aζ).

<b> A.2</b>  \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> 
is a <i>maqtil</i> form with a feminine termination. Many <i>maqtil</i> forms denote a utensil (BL, 492 qζ, sζ; Meyer 1969:34-35). 


##<span id="Syn">3. Syntagmatics</span>


<b> A.1</b> 
In 1 Sam 13:20, <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרַשְׁתּוֹ</span>
and <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁתוֹ</span>
represent the first and fourth objects
of the verb <span dir="rtl">לטשׁ</span>, ‘to forge, hammer, sharpen’. The other objects are 
(2) <span dir="rtl">אֵתֹו</span>
and
(3) <span dir="rtl">קַרְדֻּמּוֹ</span>
(all marked by the accusative particle <span dir="rtl">את</span>).
1 Sam 13:21 indicates that 
the price for 
<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>
as well as some other agricultural utensils
was a → <span dir="rtl">פים</span>. 
Apparently, the price was paid for either producing or repairing them (see <a href="#Exe">below</a>).

<b> A.1</b> 
<span id="Versions">As the surveys show, the two occurrences of <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> in 1 Sam 13:20 MT have two different counterparts in all the ancient translations.</span>
α´, Pesh and Vg treat the first occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> (20<sup><small>1</small></sup>)
as a form of the same noun as <span dir="rtl">מחרשת</span> 
(21) and translate the second form (20<sup><small>2</small></sup>)  differently.
In LXX, the words representing <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> (20<sup><small>1</small></sup>) and <span dir="rtl">מחרשת</span> (21) are derivatives from the same root.
On the other hand, the translation of Tg<sup><small>J</small></sup> suggests that the second occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span> (20<sup><small>2</small></sup>) is a form of the same noun as <span dir="rtl">מחרשת</span> 
(21). This corresponds with the Masoretic vocalisation. 

<span id="Targ"><b> A.2</b> </span>
Tg<sup><small>J</small></sup> translates each of the implements mentioned in 1 Sam 13:20-21 consistently: \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> is translated by 
<span dir="rtl">פְּרָשָׁא</span> (1x); <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span> is translated by <span dir="rtl">סִכַּת פַּדְנָא</span> (2x); <span dir="rtl">קַרְדֹּם</span> is translated by <span dir="rtl">כּוּלְבָה</span> (2x); \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>  is translated by <span dir="rtl">עוּשְׁפָּא</span> (2x); 
<span dir="rtl">דָּרְבָן</span>
is translated by 
<span dir="rtl">זַקְתָּא</span>. 
The fact that Heb. <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span>
was rendered as  <span dir="rtl">סִכַּת פַּדְנָא</span>, 
‘plough-point’ (→ <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span>), 
seems to suggest that \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>
was not interpreted as such. Therefore, it may be best to translate <span dir="rtl">פְּרָשָׁא</span>
as ‘goad’.

<b>A.3</b> 
Most of the ancient translations assume that the first occurrence of 
<span dir="rtl">מחרשתו</span>
in 1 Sam 13:20 represents an implement used for ploughing
(α´,  σ´, θ´, Vg, possibly Tg<sup><small>J</small></sup>). LXX and Pesh, however, interpret the word as an implement used for harvesting.
In the case of LXX there is reason to believe that the translators of 1 Samuel misinterpreted the verb <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span>
as relating to harvesting  instead of ploughing.[^51]
In 1 Samuel, the only phrase in which the verb <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span> has the meaning ‘to plough’ occurs in 8:12:
<span dir="rtl">וְלַחֲרֹשׁ חֲרִישׁוֹ וְלִקְצֹר קְצִירוֹ</span>
(MT), literally: ‘to plough the ploughing and to harvest the harvest’.
Most mss of LXX render the phrase as καὶ θερίζειν θερισμὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τρυγᾶν τρυγητὸν αὐτου. Both θερίζειν θερισμὸν and τρυγᾶν τρυγητὸν can be translated as ‘to reap the harvest’, not as ‘to undertake the ploughing’.[^52]

<b>A.4</b>
There is insufficient reason to suppose that the Gk. translation of 1 Sam 8:12 goes back to a Heb. text that differs from 
MT.[^53] The translation of the first occurrence of
<span dir="rtl">מחרשת</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשה</span> 
in 13:20 by θέριστρον, ‘reaping-hook’, and
the rendering of <span dir="rtl">מחרשת</span>
in 13:21 by θερίζειν, ‘to harvest’, 
seem to be due to the same confusion regarding the meaning of <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> 
and its derivatives. 
In LXX<sup><small>Ant</small></sup> καὶ θερίζειν θερισμὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τρυγᾶν τρυγητὸν αὐτου is preceded by καὶ ἀροτριᾶν τὴν ἀροτρίασιν αὐτοῦ 
‘and to undertake the ploughing’.[^54] 
Apparently, the additional phrase was inserted to assimilate the LXX to the Heb. text.[^55]

<b>A.5</b>
In 1 Sam 8:12, Pesh remains close to the Masoretic reading <span dir="rtl">ולחרש חרישו ולקצר קצירו</span>
(MT).[^56] 
In the case of 1 Sam 13:20-21, however, the reading of Pesh 
(ܡܓܠܐ,
‘sickle’)
seems to have been influenced by the Gk. translation of 
the first <span dir="rtl">מחרשת</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשה</span> 
 (13:20) by θέριστρον/θεριστήριον, ‘reaping-hook’.


##<span id="LSF">5. Lexical/Semantic Fields</span>

<b> A.1</b> The noun \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> 
and often also the noun \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>
are regarded as derivatives of the verb <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, ‘to plough, engrave’.
In the Hebrew Bible, the verb is used ten times for ploughing in a literal sense[^57] 
and four or five times for ploughing in a figurative sense.[^58]
After a → <span dir="rtl">עֹל</span>, 
‘yoke’, was fasted over the necks of two animals and attached to the plough, the animals pulled (<span dir="rtl">משׁך</span> <i>qal</i>, Deut 21:3) the plough.[^59]    

<b> A.2</b> 
The nouns \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> 
and \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>
occur only in two lists of sharp utensils (1 Sam 13:20-21). The other items in the lists are 
→ <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span>,
→ <span dir="rtl">קַרְדֹּם</span>,
possibly
<span dir="rtl">שְׁלֹשׁ קִלְּשׁוֹן</span>
(→ <span dir="rtl">קִלְּשׁוֹן</span>),
and → <span dir="rtl">דָּרְבָן</span>.

<b> A.3</b> Koller (2012:255) assumes that 
the \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>
was very similar to the → <span dir="rtl">מַעְדֵּר</span>
and that the different words may even designate the same tool.


##<span id="Exe">6. Exegesis</span>

###<span id="Exe-lit">6.1 Textual Evidence</span>

<b> A.1</b>  In view of the meaning of <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, 
‘to plough, engrave’, it is likely that 
one of the  occurrences of
<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁה</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁת</span> 
in the list of utensils in 1 Sam 13:20 denotes an implement used for ploughing.
Most dictionaries interpret either \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> 
or \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> as ‘ploughshare’.[^60]
In the Mishnah, Tosefta and Talmudim, the noun <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> designates the entire plough, while the cognates in Arab. and Eth. (and possibly in Ug.) also denote a plough (see 
<a href="#Ugar">above</a>).   
Most of the ancient translations assume that the first item in the list of 13:20 
represents a plough (α´, θ´), 
or its cutting part ( σ´, Vg, possibly Tg<sup><small>J</small></sup>). Since the plough is one of the most important agricultural utensils, it is indeed not unlikely that it is represented by the first item in the list.[^61]
In view of the evidence from the Mishnah, Tosefta and Talmudim,
it is attractive to revocalise the first occurrence in 13:20 as <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁתוֹ</span>
(with <i>ṣ<sup><small>e</small></sup>rē</i>) and to maintain the vocalisation of the parallel item <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>
in 13:21 (see <a href="#seree">above</a>).

<b> A.2</b> 
Ploughs were largely made of wood, as is shown by the burning of
<span dir="rtl">כְּלִי הַבָּקָר</span>,
‘equipment of the oxen’, which had just been used for ploughing a field
(1 Kgs 19:19-21), 
and the use of
<span dir="rtl">כְּלִי הַבָּקָר</span>,
‘equipment of the oxen’, for its wood
(<span dir="rtl">עֵצִים</span>;
2 Sam 24:22).
However, 1 Sam 13:19-22 demonstrates that ploughs also comprised a sharp element made of metal, apparently the 
so-called ‘plough-point’. The latter passage records that in the time of Saul and Jonathan the Israelites 
were subject to rigid constraints. 
The Philistines maintained a monopoly that enabled them to dominate the Israelites and
to prevent them from producing their own weapons.
According to many scholars, the monopoly 
concerned the production and/or repair of iron implements.[^62] 
However, the MT does not say explicitly that the implements involved were made of iron. 
It reveals only that among the Israelites there was no <span dir="rtl">חָרָשׁ</span>,
‘craftsman’ (13:19), 
who produced 
(<span dir="rtl">לטשׁ</span>; 13:20)
utensils for them.[^63] 
Only the renderings of <span dir="rtl">חָרָשׁ</span>
in LXX (τέκτων σιδήρου) and Vg (<i>faber ferrarius</i>)
specify that the craftsmen concerned were iron smiths.[^64] Actually, archaeological evidence from consecutive centuries 
demonstrates that in ancient Israel implements of bronze and implements of iron were used in the same contexts. 
Bronze plough-points and iron plough-points were also excavated in the same excavation layers (see <a href="#Exe-ar">below</a>).
The suggestion of LXX and Vg 
that the Philistines maintained an iron monopoly is 
an attractive option, but the MT may imply that the Philistines forbade all metallurgical activities among the Israelites.[^65]   
The structure of the ancient Israelite ploughs is not described in the HB or other contemporaneous 
sources. However, a reconstruction is possible on the basis of contemporaneous 
illustrations from Mesopotamia and Egypt and archaeological finds from
Israel/Palestine (see <a href="#Exe-ico">below</a>). Further, some terminological information can be found in the 
Mishnah, the Tosefta and the Talmudim, especially in <span id="Kelim">mKelim 21:2.[^66] 
In the latter passage, the word <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> does not occur, but
the following terms are used to denote elements of the plough:
<span dir="rtl">עֹל</span> (‘yoke’),
<span dir="rtl">קַטְרֵב</span> (‘cross-bar?’),
<span dir="rtl">עַיִן</span> (‘collar-piece?’),
<span dir="rtl">עֲבֹות</span> (‘thick ropes?’),
<span dir="rtl">חֶרֶב</span> (‘tail-piece’ or ‘handle’),
<span dir="rtl">בֹּרֶךְ</span> (‘knee-shaped beam’),
<span dir="rtl">יָצוּל</span> (‘handle’ or ‘cross-piece’),
<span dir="rtl">עַיִן שֶׁל מַתֶּכֶת</span> (‘metal ring’),
<span dir="rtl">לְחָיַיִן</span> (‘guides’),
<span dir="rtl">עֲרָיִין</span> (‘plough-flanks’ or ‘mouldboards’).
Unfortunately, it remains unclear to which elements of the plough some of these Heb. terms refer.[^67] Also, it is dubious whether the ancient Israelite plough consisted of the same elements as the plough type to which this section of the Mishnah refers.

<b> A.3</b> 
Philip King and Lawrence Stager give the following description of the way in which ploughing was performed in ancient Israel (King & Stager 2001:92; cf. 88):

> Plowing prepared the ground for sowing in late October-November, after the first rain (<i>yôreh</i>) had softened the earth. A field was plowed twice, once to loosen the crusty soil before the seed was broadcast, and then at right angles to the first plowing to cover the seed. The metal-tipped scratch plow did not turn over the soil the way a moldboard plow does but simply scratched a shallow furrow by breaking and loosening the soil.


Like the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian ploughs, ancient Israelite ploughs were usually pulled by a pair (<span dir="rtl">צֶמֶד</span>) of oxen (<span dir="rtl">בָּקָר</span>:
1 Sam 11:7; 1 Kgs 19:21; Amos 6:12; Job 1:3, 14; 42:12). A female cow could also be use for ploughing, as is shown by the remark that in specific situations a cow that had not yet carried a yoke or pulled a plough was used (<span dir="rtl">פָּרָה</span>, ‘cow’: Num 19:2; 1 Sam 6:7;
<span dir="rtl">עֶגְלָה</span>, ‘heifer’: 
Deut 21:3; cf. Judg 14:18; Hos 10:11).
Donkeys could also be used to work the land (cf. Isa 30:24: <span dir="rtl">עֲיָרִים</span>, 
‘male donkeys’), but it was forbidden to let an ox (<span dir="rtl">שׁוֹר</span>)
and a donkey (<span dir="rtl">חֲמֹור</span>)
pull a plough together (Deut 22:10).[^68]

<b> A.4</b> If the second occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁתו</span>
in 1 Sam 13:20 is left unemended,[^69] 
only one of the two occurrences may be assumed to designate a plough(-point).[^70] 
A classical translation of the second occurrence is ‘mattock’.[^71]
Eduard König interpreted \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span> as ‘wahrscheinlich der Schollenzerteiler, mit dem bei den Alten hinter dem Pfluge die grossen Erdklumpen zerteilt wurden’ (<i>HAWAT</i>, 219). 
Dominique Barthélemy decided to leave it untranslated (<i>CTAT</i> 1:181). 
<span id="Cook">Stephen Cook supposed that the first of the near-homonyms derives from <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, ‘to plough, engrave’,</span>
while the second derives from <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">ii</span>, 
‘to manufacture’
(see <a href="#RCM">above</a>).
According to Cook, the first noun clearly refers to a plough,
while the second noun, which can be translated as ‘crafted/forged tool’, can best be interpreted as an equivalent
of the parallel term <span dir="rtl">דָּרְבָן</span>,
probably ‘goad’ (end of 13:21).[^72]
However, the interpretation of the final item in the list of 13:20 remains uncertain, as Cook admits.[^73] 
Actually, the interpretation as a ‘goad’ is not attractive, since the presence of a metal point at the end of goads 
was not essential.[^74]
This noun can also be seen as a derivative of <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>
and may refer to a different tool used for ‘engraving’ the soil, wood, etc. 
<span id="Koller">However, Aaron Koller (2012:86-89) distinguished a third root, <i>ḫrś</i>/<span dir="rtl">חרשׂ</span>, ‘to scratch’, assuming that <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span> </span>
means only ‘to plough’, not ‘to engrave’ or ‘to scratch’ (see <a href="#KollerRoot">above</a>). He interpreted 
\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> as deriving from <span dir="rtl">חרשׂ</span>, ‘to scratch’.
With reference to Yemeni Arab. <i>mḫrš</i>, ‘harrow’, and <i>ḫrš</i>, ‘to till by hand’,
he suggested that the noun \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> designates a hoe or a harrow. 
The noun may indeed represent a tool for weeding or tilling the soil by hand 
(cf. <i>sarculum</i> in Vg).[^75] 

<b> B.1</b> Only rarely is none of the occurrences of <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁה</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁת</span> in 1 Sam 13:20-21  identified with a plough or an 
element of it.[^76]  

###<span id="Exe-ico">6.2 Pictorial Material</span>

<b> A.1</b>
The lack of ancient pictures of ploughs from the Levant
(Syria-Palestine) is compensated by images
from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The ploughs are commonly depicted as drawn by two oxen.[^77]
The images show two types of plough: 

  - 
Simple ploughs without a seed drill drawn by a pair of animals and guided by a single man, who may hold a stick or goad or whip to drive 
the animals.[^78] In such cases, the seeding was done after the first ploughing.
The distinction between the two procedures is illustrated by images displaying a sower who works at some distance from the ploughman and his plough.[^79] 
  - 
Ploughs provided with a seed drill, drawn by a pair of animals and guided by a single man, 
who is assisted by another man, who takes care of the seeding process.[^80]

The depicted ploughing scenes are Mesopotamian or Egyptian, but there are good reasons to believe that the ploughs of the Israelites were quite similar to 
the ploughs on the images. In ancient Israel, ploughs were not yet provided with a seed drill 
and the sowing took place after the first ploughing of the ground.[^81]
Therefore, the Israelite ploughs were probably of the same type as the simpler ploughs
of the Mesopotamians and Egyptians.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Figure&nbsp;1:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Egyptian ploughing scene, burial chamber of Sennedjem, 13th century BCE</small>

The ploughs of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian depictions have the following features in common:

  - 
A wooden beam connects the plough with a yoke that was fastened over the necks of the pulling animals. 
  - 
The essential part of the plough is a wooden beam protruding forward in the direction of the animals, at the bottom of the plough. 
The beam may be curved and is provided with a sharp metal point that makes furrows in the ground.
  - 
The plough includes a wooden handle or a pair of handles, serving to steer the plough. Usually, the steering handle is part of the same beam as the wood to which
the plough-point was affixed. 


<b> A.2</b> 
Photographs from the early twentieth century show traditional ploughs with construction styles that hardly differed from the ancient Near Eastern 
structures.[^82]

Recent film recordings show a way of ploughing that gives an impression of the ways in which ploughing was performed in the ancient Near East. Several informative recordings from, for example, Egypt and India have been uploaded on YouTube:

<b> A.3</b> 
\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> may denote a hoe or harrow (see <a href="#Koller">6.1 A.4</a>).
For ancient pictures of hoes from the Levant
(Syria-Palestine), see → <span dir="rtl">מַעְדֵּר</span>.


###<span id="Exe-ar">6.3 Archaeology</span>

<b> A.1</b> 
The wood of ancient Near Eastern ploughs  has usually decomposed completely, but many metal plough-points have survived. 
The archaeological evidence from Israel/Palestine
shows that in the twelfth century <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">bce</span> 
bronze plough-points began to be replaced by iron plough-points, although the use of bronze plough-points appears to have continued for several
centuries.[^83] 
Oded Borowski offers an excellent description of the excavated plough-points:

> The plow-point was an elongated tool, 20-30 cm long, with a pointed tip for soil penetration. 
The other end was shaped like a pipe, ca. 8-10 cm wide. A wooden shaft, which was part of the 
plow-handle, was inserted into this end.[^84]

Koller (2012:89-90) shows that the archaeological evidence corresponds with the idea expressed in the Mishnah and Tosefta 
that the <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> scratches the soil to a depth of not more than ‘three handbreaths’ (<span dir="rtl">שְׁלשָׁה טְפָחִין</span>).
He defines the <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> as ‘a piece of metal hammered into the shape of a cone and attached at the end of the wooden plow, which cuts through
the soil to a depth of about 15-30 cm.’ (2012:253).
Nowadays, the designation ‘ploughshare’ is commonly used for the curved blade of the so-called mouldboard plough, which turns over the soil.
It is confusing to denote the cutting element of the  ancient Israelite scratch ploughs as ‘ploughshare’, since its form and function where quite different
from the ploughshares of mouldboard ploughs. Therefore, Borowski’s designation as ‘plough-points’ is preferable.[^85]


<b>A.2</b> 
\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> may denote a hoe or harrow (see <a href="#Koller">6.1 A.4</a>). For remains of hoes from the Levant (Syria-Palestine), see → <span dir="rtl">מַעְדֵּר</span>.


##<span id="Con">7. Conclusion</span>

<b> A.1</b> 
In Biblical Hebrew, the noun \*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> (< <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>, ‘to plough’)
probably denotes the ancient Israelite ‘plough’. 
In the Mishnah, Tosefta and Talmudim, the word <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span>
denotes the plough as a whole. It is possible that one of the occurrences
of <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁה</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁת</span>
in 1 Sam 13:20  also designates the entire plough, but it cannot be excluded that at this earlier stage it represented only the metal plough-point.
If in 1 Sam 13:20 the first occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁתו</span>
represents a plough, the form must probably be revocalised as  <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁתוֹ</span>.
The vocalisation of the parallel term <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>
in 13:21 can be retained and this form can be translated as ‘ploughs’ or ‘plough-points’.







<b> A.2</b>  The proposals to emend the second occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁתו</span> 
in 1 Sam 13:20 are debatable. The noun
\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֶשֶׁת</span>/\*<span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁה</span> may denote a hoe or harrow (see <a href="#Koller">6.1 A.4</a>),
but it is not possible to identify the designated tool with certainty.

[^53]: Grillet and Lestienne (1997:197) suggest that the Heb. source used by the Gk. translators  read <span dir="rtl">ולקצר קצירו ולבצר בצירו</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">ולחרש חרישו ולקצר קצירו</span> (MT). See also DJD  XVII, 59. However, in addition to the deviating Gk. rendering of <span dir="rtl">מחרשת</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשה</span> in 1 Sam 13:20-21, reference must be made to a fragment of 4Q51/4QSam<sup><small>a</small></sup> showing the letters <span dir="rtl">[ולחר]ש חר̊[ישו]</span> at the expected position (DJD XVII, 58). The Gk. translation seems to be due to confusion about the meaning of Heb. <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span>; see Wirth 2017:5.
[^54]: Fernández Marcos & Busto Saiz 1989:22; Taylor 1992:25.
[^55]: McCarter argues that the Antiochene text of LXX reflects the initial Heb. reading (reconstructed as <span dir="rtl">לחרש חרישו ולקצר קצירו ולבצר בצירו</span>). This leads to the artificial assumption that the shorter readings of MT and the rest of LXX are ‘haplographic, each in its own way’ (McCarter 1980:155).
[^56]: Pesh reads  ܘܢܕܒܪܘܢ ܕܒܪܗ ܘܢܚܨܕܘܢ ܚܨܕܗ  (<i>wndbrwn dbrh wnḥṣdwn ḥṣdh</i>).  The verb ܕܒܪ  (<i>dbr</i>) is a common translation of Heb.  <span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i</span>  with the meaning ‘to plough’ (see  Deut 22:10;  1 Kgs 19:19, etc.),  while ܚܨܕ  (<i>ḥṣd</i>) is a standard translation of the verb <span dir="rtl">קצר</span> (see 1 Sam 6:13; 2 Kgs 4:18; 19:29, etc.).

[^62]: Klein 1983:127-28; Van der Steen 2008:67; 2009:69.
[^63]: The verb <span dir="rtl">לטשׁ</span> means ‘to forge, hammer, sharpen’. 1 Sam 13:20-21 was often assumed to relate to the repair of metal implements (e.g., McCarter 1980:232; Klein 1983:128), but is likelier that the passage has their production in mind.  See Stoebe 1973:254-55.

[^66]: In addition to mKelim 21:2, see the evidence</span> discussed in <a href="#Postbib">1.

[^70]: Gesenius, <i>TPC</i> i:530,  translated one of the occurrences as <i>vomer</i>, ‘ploughshare’, and the other as <i>cultrum</i>, ‘knife’, <i>dens aratri</i>, ‘plough-point’.
[^71]: KJV, ASV, NJPS. In these translations, not only the final item of the list in 13:20 (MT: <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשָׁתוֹ</span>) is translated as ‘mattock’, but the first item of the list in 13:21 (MT: <span dir="rtl">מַחֲרֵשֹׁת</span>) is also translated as ‘mattocks’, undoubtedly because these forms have the <i>ṣ<sup><small>e</small></sup>rē</i> vowel in common.
[^72]: Cook 1994. In <i>DCH</i>, where the first occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁה</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁת</span>  in 13:20 is translated as ‘ploughshare’, the second occurrence is also interpreted as ‘goad’ because of the parallelism with <span dir="rtl">דָּרְבָן</span> (<i>DCH</i> v:229-30).
[^73]: Cook 1994:252, 254, n. 11.

[^75]: In NASB not only <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁה</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁת</span> at the end of 13:20 but also <span dir="rtl">דָּרְבָן</span> at the end of 13:21 is translated as ‘hoe’.
[^76]: Fokkelman (1986:45) identified the first occurrence of <span dir="rtl">מחרשׁה</span>/<span dir="rtl">מחרשׁת</span> in 1 Sam 13:20 with a scythe, probably due to LXX θέριστρον.  Like many others (see <a href="#Emend2">above</a>), Fokkelman replaced the second occurrence  in the same verse by <span dir="rtl">חֶרְמֵשׁ</span>, ‘sickle’.
[^77]: Wiggermann (1999:189-90, 228) remarks that if one ox is depicted this must be due to artistic convention, ‘since one ox cannot pull a plough in a straight line’ (190). Differently: Borowski 1987:51; Seidl 2003-2005:514.
