<b>A.1</b> 

## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  <i>Semitic</i>:Perhaps Hamito-Semitic  *<i>ʾaḫ</i> ‘fire’ (Egyptian <i>3ḫt</i>; cf. Orel & Stolbova, <i>HSED</i>, 7).


<i>Egyptian</i>:A loan from Egyptian <i>ʿḫ</i> ‘brazier, firepan’ (Erman & Grapow, <i>WÄS</i>, vol. 1, 223) seems likely (Müller 1900, followed by e.g. Kelso, <i>CVOT</i>, 16, No. 34; Lambdin 1953, 146; Ellenbogen, <i>FWOT</i>, 21; <i>HALAT</i>, 28; <i>HAHAT</i>, 32; <i>CEDHL</i>, 16; <i>NIDOT</i>, vol. 1, 349), even though normally Egyptian ʿ does not correspond to Hebrew <span dir="rtl">א</span>. However, the latter argument is not conclusive because in this case two different laryngals in one short word were involved. The Egyptian <i>ʿḫ</i> was used for grilling (sacrificial) meat, burning incense and warming rooms. Especially the latter circumstance suggests that it was a fairly large brazier. The circumstance that it was also used to bake the typical flat bread of the Near East (in Egyptian: <i>t-ʿḫ</i> ‘brazier bread’) ties in with the translation of LXX, see below section 5.








<i>Phoenician, Punic</i>:Some authors refer to Punic <i>ʾḥt šmm</i> (<i>KAI</i> No. 145:4) but the meaning of this is hardly ‘the braziers of heaven’ and a connection with Hebrew <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> is highly uncertain (<i>KAI</i>, Bd. 2, 142; <i>DISO</i>, 9).

## <a id="AV"></a>4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions (αʹ, σʹ, θʹ)</b>:  

* Jer 36:22.23 [bis] ἐσχάρα (cf. → <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span>,5.) - <i>LSJ</i>, 699a: 1. ‘hearth, fire-place’; 2. 
‘pan of coals, brazier’; etc.;  <i>GELS-L</i>, 182b: 
‘grate, grating’ (Exod 27:4 etc.) and ‘hearth, 
fire-place’ (Prov 26:21 ἐσχάρα ἄνθραξιν καὶ ξύλα πυρί  for MT <span dir="rtl">לְאֵשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְעֵצִים</span> <span dir="rtl">לְגֶחָלִים</span> <span dir="rtl">פֶּּחָם</span>  ‘&lt;as&gt; charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire’). Cf. Curtis, <i>AFT</i>, 290: ‘... unleavened, or flat, breads (ἄρτος ἄζυμος) were baked on a brazier in ashes (ἐγκρυφίας and σποδίτης) or charcoal (ἀπανθρακίς) -- sometimes called simply ‘‘brazier-bread’’ (ἐσχάριτης)’. <i>GELS-M</i>, 294: ‘1. hearth ...; 2. grid or lattice-work forming the base of various structures’.


<b>b.  Peshitta (Pesh):</b>  

* 
Jer 36:22 <i>wnwrʾ symyn hww qdmwhy</i>, ‘and they placed a fire before him’, perhaps inspired by Tg;  Jer 36:23 [1e] <i>wšdh bgwmrʾ dnwrʾ</i> ‘and he threw it in the charcoals of the fire’ (cf. Rom 
12:20) for MT <span dir="rtl">אֶל&thinsp;־הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">אֲשֶׁר</span> <span dir="rtl">אֶל&thinsp;־הָאֵשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְהַשְׁלֵךְ</span>; </i>gmwrtʾ</i>(plur. <i>gwmrʾ</i>, cf. Nöldeke, <i>Kurzgefasste syrische Grammatik</i>, § 81): 
Brockelmann, <i>LS</i>, 121b-22a: 1. ‘pruna, carbo’; 2. 
‘variolae’ ἄνθρακες; 3. plur. ‘particula hostiae’; Payne Smith, <i>TS</i>, 740-41: ‘pruna, carbo’ ἄνθραξ; Payne Smith (Margoliouth), <i>CSD</i>, 72a: ‘a coal, live coals’, <i>gwmry dnwrʾ</i> ‘fiery coals’, etc. (but 64b <i>ad</i> <i>gwmryn</i>: ‘burning coals’, cf. RSV <i>ad</i> Rom. 12:20);   36:23 
[2e] <i>dyqdt klh mgltʾ bnwrʾ dʿl qmynʾ</i> ‘so that the complete scroll was burnt in the fire that was on the κάμινος’. The latter is a Greek loanword which designates a furnace, oven or flue (<i>LSJ</i>, 872). Because this is impossible here since the fire is <i>on</i> the <i>qmynʾ</i>,  Payne Smith (Margoliouth) may have opted for a wider semantic range: ‘a stove, fire-place, metal (!, MDK) hearth’ (<i>CSD</i>,  508b).         


<b>c. Targum (Tg):</b>  

* Jer 36:22 <span dir="rtl">נורא</span> <span dir="rtl">וית</span> ‘and the fire (before him they lit)’. For MT <span dir="rtl">האח</span> <span dir="rtl">ואת</span> Tg<br>possibly read <span dir="rtl">האשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">ואת</span>, because <span dir="rtl">נורא</span> is the normal rendering of <span dir="rtl">אשׁ</span>, but harmonisation cannot be excluded.  Jer 36:23 [1e] <span dir="rtl">דלגומרא</span> <span dir="rtl">לנורא</span>, ‘onto the fire of charcoal’; a well-attested variant reading is <span dir="rtl">דלגומרי</span> <span dir="rtl">לנורא</span> ‘onto the fire of charcoals’ (plural, harmonising),for MT <span dir="rtl">האח</span> <span dir="rtl">אל</span> <span dir="rtl">אשׁר</span> <span dir="rtl">האשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">אל</span>;  36:23 [2e] <span dir="rtl">גומרי</span> <span dir="rtl">דעל</span> <span dir="rtl">נורא</span> <span dir="rtl">על</span>  ‘onto the fire which was over the charcoals’ for MT <span dir="rtl">האח</span> <span dir="rtl">על</span> <span dir="rtl">אשׁר</span> <span dir="rtl">האשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">על</span>.<br> <span dir="rtl">גומרא</span>  (plur. <span dir="rtl">גומרין</span>) -- Jastrow, 223a: ‘burning, glowing coal’; Dalman, <i>ANHT</i>, 82b (sg. <span dir="rtl">גומרתא</span>): ‘glühende Kohle’ (Lev 16:12;  2 Sam 22:9). So the Tg thinks of a fire of glowing charcoal, but omits to specify the container.


<b>d.  Vulgate (Vg):</b>  

* 
Jer 36:22, 23 [bis] <i>arula[m]</i> - ‘small altar’ 
(Lewis & Short, <i>LD</i>, 169); in v. 22 <i>plena prunis</i> ‘full of coals’ for 
MT <span dir="rtl">מְבֹעָרֶת</span>.

### 6.1 Textual Evidence


<b>A.1</b> The <i>status absolutus</i> of this noun is given alternately as <span dir="rtl">אָח</span>  (like <span dir="rtl">אָח</span> I ‘brother’ and <span dir="rtl">אָח</span> II ‘aha!’, and ‘alas!’; so e.g. <i>TPC</i>; <i>BDB</i>; <i>LHA</i>; <i>DCH</i>) or <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> (with article: <span dir="rtl">הָאָח</span>; so e.g. <i>BL</i> § 263m; <i>GB</i>; <i>KBL</i>; <i>HALAT</i>; <i>HAHAT</i>). Fem., cf. Jer 36:22 <span dir="rtl">מְבֹעָרֶת</span>.

The word occurs in Jeremiah 
36:22, 23[bis] only. It figures prominently in 
the story of the scroll (<span dir="rtl">מְגִלַּת&thinsp;־סֵפֶר</span>, Jer 36:2 → <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>) written by Baruch ben-Neriah, as dictated by Jeremiah, which culminates -- after its promulgation 
to the people in the temple and to the king’s 
dignitaries in the secretary’s chamber in the 
royal palace -- in it being read by Jehudi 
ben-Nethaniah (cf. v. 14) to king Jehoiakim 
himself in the court (v. 20), in the winter 
house/room (<span dir="rtl">הַחֹרֶף</span> <span dir="rtl">בֵּית</span>, v. 22, cf. Amos 3:15), in the ninth month (November/December) (cf. De Vaux, <i>IAT</i>, t. 1, 290). Before him 
the king had the  <span dir="rtl">אַח</span>: <span dir="rtl">לְפָנָיו</span> <span dir="rtl">וְאֶת&thinsp;־הָאָח</span> which had been kindled (<span dir="rtl">מְבֹעָרֶת</span>, v. 22).

Thus <i>GKC</i> §117l (readJer 36<sup>22</sup> instead of Jer 36<sup>33</sup> <i>ad loc</i> and in the 
Index, p. 585), cf. Joüon, <i>GHB</i> §125j 
(p. 370, ‘Remarque’); ‘The brasier before him was 
burning’, <i>BDB</i>, 29a. Others read <span dir="rtl">וְאֵשׁ</span> ‘and the fire’ for <span dir="rtl">וְאֶת</span>  (e.g. <i>HALAT</i>, 97b; <i>BHS</i> <i>ad loc</i>; the remark ‘cf LXXPeshTg’ 
is misleading): ‘the fire in the brazier before 
him had been kindled’; or, with LXX (καὶ ἐσχάρα πυρὸς), <span dir="rtl">הָאֵשׁ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְאָח</span>  for <span dir="rtl">וְאֶת&thinsp;־הָאָח</span>: ‘während die geheizte Kohlenpfanne vor ihm 
brannte’ (Giesebrecht 1907, 200, who disposes of the reading <span dir="rtl">וְאֶת</span> of MT as ‘eine unnöthige, ja komische Weitschweifigkeit 
bei einer einfachen Sache’).



The <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> is used by Jehoiakim to destroy the scroll bit by bit: every three orfour columns (→ <span dir="rtl">דֶּלֶת</span>) that had been read by Jehudi, were cut off by him with a penknife (→ <span dir="rtl">תַֹּעַר</span>) and thrown (<span dir="rtl">וְהַשְׁלֵךְ</span>, inf. abs. as the continuation of a preceding finite verb, cf. <i>GKC</i> §113z) into 
the fire that was in the <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> (<span dir="rtl">אֶל&thinsp;־הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">אֲשֶׁר</span> <span dir="rtl">אֶל&thinsp;־הָאֵשׁ</span>), until the entire scroll was consumed (<span dir="rtl">כָּל&thinsp;־הַמְּגִלָּה</span> <span dir="rtl">עַד&thinsp;־תֹֹּם</span>) in the fire that was in the <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> (<span dir="rtl">עַל&thinsp;־הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">אֲשֶׁר</span> <span dir="rtl">עַל&thinsp;־הָאֵשׁ</span>, v. 23 [bis]).


There may have occurred some interchange of <span dir="rtl">אֶל</span>  and <span dir="rtl">עַל</span>  in v. 23 by assimilation: probably (the first) <span dir="rtl">הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">אֶל</span>  should be read as <span dir="rtl">הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">עַל</span>, like (the second) <span dir="rtl">הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">עַל</span>, cf. LXX ἐπὶ (bis), Vg <i>super arulam</i> (for <span dir="rtl">הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">אֶל</span>; the second time <i>in arula</i>, for <span dir="rtl">הָאָח</span> <span dir="rtl">עַל</span>!). Tg and Pesh, however, only have <i>dʿl</i> for  <span dir="rtl">עַל</span> (see ad 5. for their rendering of <span dir="rtl">אֶל</span>). For <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>  followed by <span dir="rtl">עַל</span>, cf. Lev 1:7 and 6:5f. [12f.] (<span dir="rtl">עַל&thinsp;־הַמִּזְבֵּחַ</span> <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>), Jer 11:16 (set [<span dir="rtl">יצת</span> Hiph.] fire to the tree [<span dir="rtl">עָלֶיהָ</span>]), and Ezek 21:36 [31] and 22:20 (with <span dir="rtl">נפח</span>  ‘blow’). More often <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span> is followed by <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span>, with <span dir="rtl">יצת</span>  Hiph. (Jer 17:27, 21:14 etc.), <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> (Ezek. 30:8, 14, 16, etc.) or <span dir="rtl">שׁלח</span>  Piel (Amos 1:4, 7, 10, etc.), or by <span dir="rtl">מִן</span>, with <span dir="rtl">ירד</span>  (2 Kgs 1:10.12, etc.) or <span dir="rtl">יצא</span>  (Lev. 9:24; 10:2; Num 16:35; 21:28, etc.).






Nothing is said about the size of the <span dir="rtl">אַח</span>, nor of the material from which is was made, ofthe kind of fuel that was burnt in it or of its 
movability. Kelso (<i>CEVOT</i>, 34) thinks that, as a king, 
Jehoiakim probably would have used a metal 
brazier, but a ceramic one ‘must not be 
completely ruled out’. As several columns of the 
scroll could be thrown into the <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> all at once and finally the whole scroll was consumed in it, 
the <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> must have been of some size (‘<i>olla magna</i>’, Gesenius & Roediger, <i>TPC</i>, 69a), not just a small fire pot 
or spirit stove, and not ‘<i>super prunas suspensa</i>’ 
(Zorell, <i>LHA</i>, 30a): the fire was in/on the pan, 
not under it. Perhaps the use of the 
preposition <span dir="rtl">עַל</span>  ‘on’ also points to a fire-pan with a fairly wide and flat bottom, cf. the fire 
put or kept (up)on the altar, Lev 1:7; 6:5f. 
[12f.], and Vg translating 
<span dir="rtl">אַח<span> with <i>arula</i>, 
‘small altar’ (in Jer 36:23, 
however, the RSV and other modern versions 
translate: ‘the fire &lt;that was&gt; in the brazier’; 
but Giesebrecht: ‘auf der Kohlenpfanne’ 
[bis]).


Some authors translate <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> as ‘hearth’ (see bibliography below), but this is unlikely. The king was seated (<span dir="rtl">יֹושֵׁב</span>, v. 22) and the <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> was positioned before him (<span dir="rtl">לְפָנָיו</span>, v. 22), so he must have bent over to throw the leaves he had cut off in the fire. Because leather does not burn well, it is likely that the scroll was made of papyrus (→ <span dir="rtl">מְגִלָּה</span>). Since a leaf of papyrus is very light, the distance between the king’s hand and the brazier cannot have been large, otherwise the pages would have fluttered around erratically. This argues in favour of a brazier on legs. Cf. King & Stager, <i>LBI</i>, 34: ‘This was probably a copper or bronze, three-legged hearth’.
N.B.: <span dir="rtl">הֶאָח</span>  in Isa. 44:16 <span dir="rtl">חַמֹּותִי</span> <span dir="rtl">הֶאָח</span> has been interpreted, already from LXX onwards, as an interjection: ‘aha!’ 
(cf. Ezek 25:3, 26:2, etc.), probably correctly 
so.

The rabbis did not know the meaning of the word anymore. Their guesses are recorded b. Shab., 20a (cf. Levy, <i>WTM</i>, Bd. 1, 54a).


Several medieval Jewish commentators, however, describe the <span dir="rtl">אח</span> as a metal brazier or frying pan (Rubiato Díaz <i>et. al.</i> 1991, 375).




### 6.2 Pictorial Material

<b>A.1</b> 
Whereas clay burners were extensively used among Palestinians (Dalman, <i>AuS</i>, Bd. 4, Abb. 5, 6, 11, and Bd. 7, Abb. 34, 52a, 96, 
98-100; Avitzur, 108-9, 116-7), metal braziers were too expensive for common people.

### 6.3 Archaeology

<b>A.1</b> ‘The most common means of heating was, therefore, 
the brazier’, ‘in classical times there were no 
special devices for heating the home except the 
usual small portable fires with charcoal, the 
braziers’ (Forbes, <i>SAT</i>, vol. 6, 31, cf. 16f., 30, 
61 [Rome], and 65 [Egypt, Mesopotamia], all 
mentioning charcoal; in ancient Palestine, 
however, wood and straw were preferably used, 
<i>ibid.</i>, 15f., 64); charcoal (<span dir="rtl">פֶּּחָם</span>) was a costly fuel, cf. j. Ter., 45d; ‘Abod. Zar., 41a; Exod. R., 
42 (99a); ‘It was also used   in the portable 
stove or brazier in the King’s palace’ <i>(ibid.</i>,  20, 
with notes 126-131). According to Kelso, the king 
probably would have been using a metal brazier, 
but ‘the common Israelite would employ a pottery 
one just as does the poor Arab today’. However, 
as ‘ceramic work, when highly decorative, could 
compete with metal ware’, a brazier of clay must 
not completely be ruled out (Kelso [34, p. 16], 
referring to the elaborately decorated incense 
altar found at Taanach and the cult shrines at 
Beth-shan and Megiddo; cf: ‘carrying &lt;fire&gt; in 
clay hearths’, Forbes, <i>op. cit.</i>, 6, 2). For Kelso’s remark on ‘the stove 
family’, → <span dir="rtl">כִּירַיִם</span>, 8.   


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> Many mysteries still remain around <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> which is <i>de facto</i> a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, though not recognised as such by Greenspahn, <i>HLBH</i> and Cohen, <i>BHL</i>. In Jer 36:22, but also in v. 23, confusion and interchange with <span dir="rtl">אֵת</span>  and/or <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>  could have taken place in the textual tradition, see Section 5 on the ancient versions.


Analysis of the context learns that the  <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> which was standing before the king was probably a metal brazier on three or four legs.  As it is not said in v. 22 that the king ‘was seated before the <span dir="rtl">אַח</span>’  but that somehow the  <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> ‘was positioned before the king (<span dir="rtl">לְפָנָיו</span>)’, it seems most likely that a movable brazier or fire-pan had been placed in 
front of the king, cf. Vulg. <i>et posita erat arula 
coram eo</i> and Pesh. <i>wnwrʾ symyn hww qdmwhy</i>; 
cf. Giesebrecht: 1907, 200: ‘während  die geheizte 
Kohlen-pfanne vor ihm brannte’. The Egyptian word from which  <span dir="rtl">אַח</span> was probably taken over suggests a fairly large brazier, as does the number of leaves the king cut off and burnt in the  <span dir="rtl">אַח</span>.

Also the ancient versions, especially LXX, point in the direction of a fairly wide firepan (Section 5), as do some medieval Jewish commentators (Section 6). The rendering ‘brazier’ may be adopted therefore with a fair amount of confidence.
