## 1. Root And Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> See: <a href="https://pthu.github.io/sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>: 1. Root and Comparative Material</a>.


## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b> Only the plural form  <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעוֹת</span> is attested. It is not certain either from the form or from the syntagmatic context whether it is masculine or feminine. However, <i>HAL</i>, 532, suggest that it is feminine, the singular form being *<span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span> (see BL, 490e).

<b>B.1</b> Briggs and Briggs (1907:110) propose that the lexeme is an Aram. inf. from the verb <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, citing the LXX rendering. The plural form, however, makes this unlikely.

## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b> The pl. is found preceded by <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> and in predicative position to <span dir="rtl">אֵל</span>, ‘God’ (Ps 68:21). The <i>lamed</i> expresses a relational sense of God to <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָׁעוֹת</span>, perhaps a <i>lamed</i> of specification (see Waltke and O’Connor, <i>IBHS</i>,
§ 11.2.10 d). Alternatively, the <i>lamed</i> might indicate the possessive, and the expression  <span dir="rtl">אֵל לְמוֹשָׁעוֹת</span> would be comparable to the construct
chain frequent in the Psalms of  <span dir="rtl">אֱלֹהֵי יֵשַׁע</span> (e.g. Pss 18:47; 24:5).

<b>B.1</b> Gunkel (1933:290) sees the  <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> as a dittography after <span dir="rtl">אֵל</span>.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>: 

* σώζω as articular infinitive: Ps 67:21 (68:21<small><sup>MT</sup></small>).

Minor Greek Versions [MRN]:

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>: 

* <i>mpṣynʾ</i>: Ps 68:21.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: K)</b>: 

* <span dir="rtl">תקוף ופורקן</span>: Ps 68:21.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>: 

* <i>salus</i>: Ps 67:21 (68:21<small><sup>MT</sup></small>).

<b>A.1</b> The LXX, Pesh and Vg clearly understand the root meaning as ‘to save’. Although in the Tg the verse is greatly expanded, the phrase 
<span dir="rtl">תקוף ופורקן</span>, ‘protection and deliverance’ renders a similar sense, the double
translation perhaps aiming to cover the full range of the semantics of the lexeme.


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b> See: <a href="https://pthu.github.io/sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#5-lexicalsemantic-fields"><span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>: 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields’</a>.

<b>A.2</b> The noun <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span> is a hapax legomenon, found at Ps 68:21. <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span> seems to be in parallelism with both <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> ‘salvation’ in the previous verse and <span dir="rtl">לַמָּוֶת תּוֹצָאוֹת</span> ‘escapes from death’ later in the same verse.


## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b><span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span> appears in a Psalm that describes in broad terms God’s
saving acts, including the deliverance from Egypt, defeat of the
enemies, conquest of the land and protection from evil. The obvious
connection of [ <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span>] with the verb  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span>, its parallelism with
 <span dir="rtl">יְשׁוּעָה</span> and the context indicate that it is a noun denoting
‘deliverance’.

<b>A.2</b> <i>HAL</i>, 532, glosses <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span> as ‘Hilfeleistung’, and BDB, 448, preserves the plural form in its gloss ‘saving acts’.


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> The evidence from the context, the parallelisms, the Versions and the likely root <i>yšʿ</i> all point to <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span> denoting ‘deliverance’ or ‘saving act’, with reference to victories over enemies and even over death/Mot.

<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעוֹת</span> is probably the plural form of a feminine noun *<span dir="rtl">מוֹשָעָה</span>.
