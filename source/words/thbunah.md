<b>A.1</b>  Jer 51:15 is in reality a doublet of Jer 10:12: it should therefore not be counted as an independent occurrence. In this case there are 41 biblical attestations.   

<span id="InGTA2"><b>A.2</b></span>
 In Hosea 13:2 the occurrence is in the form masc.sg. + sf. 3 masc.pl. (<span dir="rtl">תְבוּנָם</span>), a form which in itself could be:   
a) An abbreviation for <span dir=‘rtl’>תְבוּנָתָם</span> (BDB: 108; <i>HAL</i>, 1548; GK, §91e; BL, 599 §74h; cf. <i>BHQ</i> 13, 70*). A similar phenomenon can be seen also in Ps 49:15 (<span dir=‘rtl’>וְציּרָם</span> = <span dir=‘rtl’>וְצוּרָתָם</span>) and Gen 40:10 (<span dir=‘rtl’>נִצָּהּ</span> = <span dir=‘rtl’>נִצָּתָהּ</span>);   
b) A northern dialectal variant (Rudolph
1966:237, cited in <i>HAL</i>, 1549a).   
In favour of the latter hypothesis and against that of a textual error (see below) or of an abbreviation are set two further data (Sciumbata 1996-97:163): 1) the existence of the doublets 
<span dir="rtl">תמור</span> (Sir)/<span dir="rtl">תְּמוּרָה</span> (BH); 
<span dir="rtl">תמות</span> (Sam. Hebrew)/<span dir="rtl">תְּמוּתָה</span> (BH)
and of the Samaritan Hebrew form <span dir="rtl">תתוב</span>, ‘repentance’, renders probable
the existence of dialectal masculine variants for the pattern <i>taqtul</i>:
the two examples from Samaritan Hebrew make one consider that northern variants are involved;
2) the same occurrence in Hosea, whose language is suspected of northern infiltration, would confirm this situation. It can also be said that, if the translations (see below) depend on a
different <i>Vorlage</i> (<span dir="rtl">תַּבְנִת</span>), it is possible to postulate a
simplification of a <i>lectio difficilior</i> which was not understood. To
strengthen the hypothesis of the masculine form against that of textual
corruption there is also a greater awareness of the special meaning of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> obtained from the research in structural semantics developed by Sciumbata (1996-97; see further below <a href="#TDB1">Text Doubtful B.1</a>.

<b>A.3</b>  In Obad 1:7 the phrase 
<span dir="rtl">אֵין תְּבוּנָה בּוֹ</span> is according to some to be omitted as a gloss, and according to others to be transferred to v. 8 (Bewer 1911:33; BHS). According to Bewer it can be kept in its place, as part of the old oracle which is quoted by the prophet (Bewer 1911:36-7).


<b>A.4</b>  In Prov 28:16 the LXX with προσόδων seem to have had in front of them a <i>Vorlage</i> <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּאוֹת</span>, ‘revenue’, instead of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנוֹת</span>  (cf. BHS). One should note that in Sir 15:3<small><sup>A</sup></small> there is an identical error (see below, A.5).

<b>A.5</b>  Sir 15:3<small><sup>A</sup></small>  presents the reading <span dir="rtl">תבואה</span>, 
which is cancelled and corrected with <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> (which is the reading of ms B).

<b>A.6</b>  In Sir 15:15<small><sup>B</sup></small> presents in the body of the text the reading <span dir="rtl">אמונה</span> in place of <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> of ms. A (the reading accepted by the Greek text): <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> is, however, given in the adjacent margin (B<sup>mg</sup>).

<b>B.1</b>  The figure of 44 occurrences furnished by Fox (1993:151) is totally incomprehensible.

<span id="TDB1"><b> 
### Text Doubtful</b></span>


<b>B.1</b>  The form <span dir="rtl">תְבוּנָם</span> in Hos 13:2 seems to have been variously interpreted by the translations. The LXX (κατ’εἰκόνα), followed by Pesh
<span dir="rtl">ܒܕܡܘܬܗܘܢ݂</span>
(<i>bdmwthwn</i>) and Vg (<i>secundum imaginem</i>), seem to have had a different <i>Vorlage</i> in front of them: <span dir="rtl">כְּתַבְנִית</span>, ‘according to the image (of the idols)’. The same is true for Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small> (<span dir="rtl">כדמותהון</span>, 
‘according to their own image’).[^1] The Babylonian Talmud, San. 63b, also interprets the text in the same way. Harper (1905:395) accepts the reading
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, only with a sarcastic meaning. The MT, nevertheless, makes perfect sense, especially taking account of the fact that a northern
dialectal variant of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> is involved, in the sense of ‘ingenuity, genius in handicraft and art’ (Sciumbata 1996-97:163 and see above). The verse would then say: ‘And now they continue to sin, with their silver they make themselves molten images according to their ingenuity’. The reading of the Ancient Versions can be interpreted as a simplification
of a <i>lectio difficilior</i>. 


### Qere/Ketiv 

In Job 26:12 K <span dir="rtl">תְובֻנָת֗וֹ</span> has been corrected by Q <span dir="rtl">תְבוּנָתוֹ</span>.

### Orthographic Variants 

In Job 32:11 the orthographic omission of the <span dir="rtl">ו</span> for the plural ending is noteworthy: in the other instances it is always present.[^2]

## 1. Root and Comparative Material


<b>A.1</b>  The noun is derived from the root <i>byn</i>, connected with the substantive <i>bayin</i>, ‘intermediate space’, which is used as a preposition (Ringgren 1973:621). The original meaning seems to be that of ‘to separate, distinguish’, which is found in the semantic developments in various Semitic languages
(Ringgren 1973:621). The root is attested in a large part of North-West Semitic and South Semitic (<i>THAT</i> 1:306; <i>HAL</i>, 117b).


<b>A.2</b> <i>Ancient Hebrew</i>: Next to <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, there are attested the verb
<dir="rtl">בין</span> in the <i>binyanim</i> <i>qal, niph, hiph, polel, hitpolel</i>; the substantive <dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, ‘discernment, understanding’, and the adjectival participles <dir="rtl">נָבוֹן</span> and <dir="rtl">מֵבִין</span>. The proper name Yabin is also connected to the root <dir="rtl">בין</span> (<i>THAT</i> 1:306). 
At Qumran <dir="rtl">מבונן</span>, ‘instructed’ and the
substantive <dir="rtl">נבונה</span> also appear (Ringgren 1973:629). The particles <dir="rtl">בין</span>, ‘between’, and <dir="rtl">בנים</span> (in the expression <span dir="rtl">אישׁ הבנים</span>, ‘challenger’? Ringgren 1973:621; <i>HAL</i>, 118, 134), as far as etymology is concerned, are connected but belong to a different semantic strand.


<b>A.3</b> <i>Mishnaic Hebrew</i>: The verb <dir="rtl">הבין</span>, the participle
<dir="rtl">מבין</span>, and the substantives <dir="rtl">בינה</span> and <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> are attested.


<b>A.4</b> <i>Ugaritic</i>: There is the verb <i>bn</i>, ‘to know, understand’.

<b>A.5</b> <i>Amorite</i>: The form <i>ya-bi-ni-im</i> presupposes *<i>byn</i>, ‘to distinguish’ (see <i>DRS</i>, 62).

<b>A.6</b> <i>Aramaic</i>: <i>DRS</i>, 62: a) Biblical: <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, ‘understanding’; b)
Palmyrene: a form <i>ybn(w)n</i> (<i>aph</i>. impf. 3 pplm) is attested from <i>byn</i>,
‘make clear, precise’; c) in Palestinian Jewish Aramaic are attested
<i>ʾ<small><sup>&nbsp;a</small></sup>bāntāʾ</i>, ‘understanding’, <i>bayyēn</i>, ‘make understand’; in
Mandaean: <i>ban</i>, ‘separate, explain’; e) Syriac: the verbs <i>bayyen</i>, ‘to
show, point out, to give instruction, understanding, to discern’, and
<i>’etbayyan</i>, ‘to notice, take notice of, regard, consider, understand,
have discretion’; the substantives <i>buyyānā’</i>, ‘understanding,
intelligence’; <i>mbynnʾ, mtbynnʾ, mtbynnwtʾ</i> (Payne Smith); f) Neo-Syriac
(Urmia): *<i>mabyin</i>, ‘to appear’; <i>binä</i>, ‘thought, understanding’ (<i>DRS</i>, 62).


<b>A.7</b> <i>Arabic</i>: <i>DRS</i>, 62: a) <i>bāna</i>, ‘to be separate from, be clear, evident’; b) Thamudic: there is a form <i>bnt</i> (3 fem.sg.) from *<i>bn</i>, ‘be
clear, evident’.


<b>A.8</b> <i>South Arabian</i>: <i>byn</i>, ‘depart, go away’ (<i>DRS</i>, 62).


<b>A.9</b>  <i>Ethiopic</i>: <i>DRS</i>, 62: a) Geez <i>bayyana</i>, ‘to distinguish,
notice’; b) Amharic: <i>bäyyänä</i> ‘to decide, decree’; c) Tigre: <i>ban</i>, ‘alone, separately’, <i>bänbän</i>, ‘different, separate’; d) Tigrin <i>baynu</i> (+ suff.), ‘alone’.

## 2. Formal Characteristics


<b>A.1</b>  The same verbal substantive with preformative <i>t</i> can be associated,
according to the meaning, with various <i>binyanim</i> (Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §88Lo): <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>
seems to derive from <i>byn</i> in <i>hiph</i>. on the pattern <i>taqtul</i>.[^4] 
The <i>u</i> of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and analogous nouns seems to derive from a closed
<i>o</i>, and hence from a primitive <i>a</i> (Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §§29bN; 88Ls).

<b>A.2</b>  The morphological forms attested are: fem.sg.; fem.sg. constr. + suff.;
fem.pl.; fem.pl. constr. + suff. There is a form 
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנֹתֵיכֶם</span> in Job 32:11
(with the Masoretic interpretation as a plural) and 
<span dir="rtl">תבונתיה</span> in Sir 14:21. In Hos 13:2 there is a masc.sg. + 3 masc.pl. suff., from a not otherwise attested *<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּן</span>.


<b>B.1</b>  According to Joüon and Muraoka (<i>GBH</i> §88Ls) the pattern <i>taqtol</i> (from <i>taqtul</i>) has no examples of masculine nouns. However if the form *<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּן</span> is really to be considered as a dialectal form of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> (see above, <a href="#InGTA2">Introduction A.2</a>), this statement should be corrected.

<b>B.2</b>  The plural <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנוֹת</span> is considered by some to be a plural of intensity, by others a singular with a final abstract termination in
<span dir="rtl">וֹת</span>– (<i>HAL</i>, 1548; GK, §124:1e). According to Dahood (1965:296ff; see
also 1970:379) the form <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנוֹת</span> in Pss 49:4 and 78:72, on the model of some occurrences of <span dir="rtl">חָכְמוֹת</span>, is equivalent to a Phoenician fem.sg. termination: but the idea seems somewhat improbable (<i>HAL</i>, 1548). Above
all the situation of some of the occurrences of <span dir="rtl">חָכְמוֹת</span> should be separated from those of the plural <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנוֹת</span>: for the latter all that can be said is that in some occurrences one should presuppose the crystallization of the plural as an autonomous lexeme to indicate ‘intelligent actions, maxims, etc.’ (Sciumbata 1996-97, see below, 
<a href="#ExA1">Exegesis A.1</a>). The pl. does not elsewhere have any other semantic peculiarity except of an intensive type (see, e.g., Isa 40:14; cf. also Fox 1993:152).

## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b>  Constructions with particles:

* <span dir="rtl">וְאֶת־הַתְּבוּנָה</span>: 1Kgs 7:14;
* <span dir="rtl">וְלֹא־תְבוּנָה</span>: Isa 44:19;
* <span dir="rtl">אֵין תְּבוּנָה</span>: Obad 1:7; in Deut 32:28 with the insertion of <span dir="rtl">בָּהֶם</span> in the middle;
* <span dir="rtl">בִּתְבוּנָה</span>: with and without suffix: Exod 31:3; 35:31; Jer 10:12 = 51:15; Ezek 28:14; Ps 136:5; Job 26:12; Prov 3:19; 18:2; 24:3; Sir 14:20; 44:3; with the noun in the pl. Ps 78:72; Sir 50:27; 11Q5 26:14; in Sir 14:21 <span dir="rtl">בתבונתיה</span> occurs;
* <span dir="rtl">לַתְּבוּנָה</span>: with and without suffix: Isa 40:28; Ps 147:5; Prov 2:2, 3; 5:1;
* <span dir="rtl">עַד־תְּבוּנֹתֵיכֶם</span>: Job 32:11;
* <span dir="rtl">כִּתְבוּנָם</span>: Hos 13:2.

<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> occurs as subject, object, accusative of material (1 Kgs
7:14; the accusative is required by the verb, 
Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §125d), second
component of a construct chain, means, in a prepositional phrase of
topic (Exod 31:3), movement to a place, dative or indirect object,
relation, time, and manner.


<b>A.3</b>  The lexeme <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’, shows solidarity with the class of
human beings, to whom it refers: in Obad 1:8 the reference to the mountain of Esau is metaphorical for the Edomites. The lexeme <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘ingenuity’, shows solidarity with the class of human beings and with God.


<b>A.4</b>  <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> ‘intelligence’ is subject of 

* <span dir="rtl">אַיִן</span>, ‘there is not’: Deut 32:28; Obad 1:7; Prov 21:30; 
* <span dir="rtl">נצר</span>, ‘to watch’: Prov 2:11;
* <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> (<span dir="rtl">קוֹל</span>), ‘to give (voice)’: Prov 8:1.


<b>A.5</b>  In 1 Kgs 7:14 the article (a unique occurrence) should be noted: it
specifies the kind of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> which is involved (the artisan-technical kind).


<b>A.6</b>  The lexeme <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘ingenuity’, can be the object of the verb <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> (with subject YHWH: Exod 36:1). In the post-exilic period the same construction passed to <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, which in its turn also inherited this meaning from <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.  
The lexeme <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’, can be the object of 

* <span dir="rtl">נתן</span>, ‘to give’ (with subject <span dir="rtl">אֱלֹהִים</span>): 1 Kgs 5:9; 
* <span dir="rtl">חסר</span>, ‘to lack’: Prov 28:16, in the syntagma <span dir="rtl">חסר תְּבוּנוֹת</span>, ‘to lack intelligence’; 
* <span dir="rtl">שׁמר</span>, ‘to keep’: Prov 19:8, Sir 15:15; 
* <span dir="rtl">אבד</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to extreminate’: Obad 1:8; 
* <span dir="rtl">פוק</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to obtain’: Prov 3:13.


<b>A.7</b>  In relation to the substantive <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘ingenuity’, <span dir="rtl">מלא</span> <i>piel</i>  also occurs in Exod 31:3, with subject YHWH and <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in a prepositional phrase of topic; 
<i>niph</i> 1 Kgs 7:14 with <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> as accusative of material.[^5]

<b>A.8</b>  In Exod 31:3-4 and 35:31-32 the aim of 
<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, and <span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, ‘skill,
ingenuity and technical knowledge’, is 
<span dir="rtl">לַחְשֹׁב מַחֲשָׁבֹת לַעֲשׂוֹת…</span>, ‘to
conceive thoughts to do …’ 
In Exod 36:1 the aim of <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> and
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘skill and ingenuity’, is <span dir="rtl">לָדַעַת לַעֲשֹׂת</span>, ‘to know how to do …’
In Deut 32:28-29 the function of 
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’, together with <span dir="rtl">עֵצוֹת</span>, ‘sense, advice’, is synthesised by the phrase 
<span dir="rtl">לוּ חָכְמוּ יַשְׂכִּילוּ זֹאת יָבִינוּ לְאַחֲרִיתָם</span>,
‘if they were wise they would understand this, they would give attention to their end’.


<b>A.9</b>  The expression 
<span dir="rtl">בִּתְבוּנָה</span> + <span dir="rtl">נטה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">עשׂה</span>, etc. + <span dir="rtl">שָׁמַיִם</span> (Jer 10:12; Ps 136:5; Prov
3:19; 11Q5 26:14) becomes a traditional cliché, which survives until Qumran (in spite of the disappearance of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> as a functional lexeme, 
see below <a href="#LSFA2">Lexical/Semantic Fields A.2</a>).

<b>A.10</b>  In 1 Kgs 5:9 the adverb 
<span dir="rtl">הַרְבֵּה מְאֹד</span> placed after <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> (<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה הַרְבֵּה מְאֹד</span>) should be understood as depending on the verb 
<span dir="rtl">נתן</span> (GK, §131e;
BDB, 915 hiph 1.e).

<b>A.11</b>  There are the following lexical syntagms:

* <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה וּתְבוּנָה</span>: the syntagm, which can also be broken up by the introduction of particles or of other elements, appears in Exod 36:1; 1 Kgs 5:9; 7:4; Ezek 28:14; Jer 10:12; Prov 2:2, 6, 11; 3:13, 19; 5:1; 8:1; 21:30; 11Q5 26:14. The syntagm expresses a concept of complete ability (in the case of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘ingenuity’), or knowledge of a theoretical-speculative kind (in the case of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’), combining (merismus) a lexeme belonging to the class of concepts with one belonging to the class of faculties (according to the description of the meaning provided by Sciumbata 1996-97, see below <a href="#LSFA1">Lexical/Semantic Fields A.1</a>. The same considerations apply to the parallelisms or the other contextual antonymies between the two lexemes. In Prov 10:23 and Sir 14:20-21a it seems that <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> depends on <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.
* <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה וּתְבוּנָה וְדַּעַת</span>: in Exod 31:3; 35:31 and 1 Kgs 7:14 (with or without the addition of particles) the three-part expression should be translated as ‘skill, ingenuity and technical knowledge’, and describes the completeness of artistic-technical ability in all its varied aspects. In Prov 21:30 there appears 
<span dir="rtl">אֵין חָכְמָה וְאֵין תְּבוּנָה וְאֵין עֵצָה</span>, ‘there is no
learning, nor intelligence, nor knowledge’.
* <span dir="rtl">דַּעַת וּתְבוּנָה</span> is a relatively frequent syntagm (Isa 40:14; Prov 2:6; 2:11; 3:19; 17:27). It appears in the negative in Isa 44:19: <span dir="rtl">וְלֹא דַעַת וְלֹא־תְבוּנָה</span>. In this case too there is a combination of a lexeme which refers
to information possessed and one which indicates a faculty (merismus). In Qumran Hebrew the syntagm is replaced by <span dir="rtl">דעת ובינה</span> (4Q158 1-2:8; 4Q405 17:3; 11Q17 5:1).
* <span dir="rtl">עֵצָה וּתְבוּנָה</span> (Job 12:13).
* <span dir="rtl">מצוה ותבונה</span> (Sir 15:15<small><sup>A</small></sup>): according to Sciumbata 1996-97, when understood in the light of Sir 45:5 the syntagm expresses the legalistic connotation assumed by <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>3</sub></small> in Ben Sira (see below <a href="#ExA1">Exegesis A.1</a>). 
While taking up the jargon lexeme of the didactic current of the wisdom movement, which designated its own <i>corpus</i> of teachings and values, Ben Sira reinterpreted it in a legalistic sense, in the wake of Deut 4:6, where, however, <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> appears. According to Sciumbata Ben Sira is aware
of the post-exilic substitution of <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> for <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, which is the reason why in respect to that text he makes, by hypercorrection, a deliberate lexical restoration. Elsewhere too this author tends to
re-establish the old variant of <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>.

<b>A.12</b>  Other contextual relations:

a) With terms from the lexical field:

* In Deut 2:2-3 the antonymy is between <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>,  and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> (the verse
provides a lexical repertoire of synonyms).
* In Sir 15:3<small><sup>A,B</sub></small> there is a parallelism with <span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span>, ‘wisdom’ (= ‘sageness’). The combination has not appeared in biblical Hebrew and should be considered as one of the elements of the late language present in Ben Sira (in spite of his attempt to maintain the classical style, especially as regards the lexicon of ‘knowledge’: Sciumbata 
1996-97:168): <span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span> in fact takes the place of <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> in this meaning in the late language (and in fact the more frequent parallelism in biblical Hebrew is between <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>).
* In Isa 40:28 it is said that there is no <span dir="rtl">חֵקֶר</span>  of the <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘ingenuity’, of God.
* In Isa 40:14 there is parallelism between <span dir="rtl">אֹרַח מִשְׁפָּט</span>, <span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, and <span dir="rtl">דֶ֥רֶךְ תְּבוּנ֖וֹת</span>.
* In Prov 11:12 and 15:21 the antonym of <span dir="rtl">אִישׁ תְּבוּנָה/תְּבוּנוֹת</span> is <span dir="rtl">חֲסַר־לֵב</span>, ‘he who lacks intellect’. In Prov 17:27 the same syntagm is parallel to <span dir="rtl">יוֹדֵעַ דָּעַת</span>.

b) With other vocabulary:

* <span dir="rtl">עֵצָה</span> (Prov 21:30; Job 12:13), <span dir="rtl">עֵצוֹת</span> (Deut 32:28).
* <span dir="rtl">רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים</span>: in Exod 31:3 and 35:31 it is said that Bezalel is full of the
spirit of God as regards skill (<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>), ingenuity (<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>) and
technical knowledge (<span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>). The spirit of God is being considered as
something which instills and empowers these human qualities.
* <span dir="rtl">מְזִמָּה</span> (Prov 2:11);
* <span dir="rtl">לֵב</span> in Prov 15:21 and <span dir="rtl">רֹחַב לֵב</span> in 1 Kgs 5:9 indicate the seat of the intellectual faculty (the same happens with other lexemes in the lexical field). Sometimes <span dir="rtl">לֵב</span> is used metonymically to indicate the whole activity which takes place there.
* In Job 12:12 there is an equivalence between <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">אֹרֶךְ יָמִים</span>: a cultural fact is involved, not implied in the linguistic meaning of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.

<b>B.1</b>  According to Alonso Schökel (<i>DBHE</i>, 792) the syntagms <span dir="rtl">בִּתְבוּנָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">כִּתְבוּנָם</span> should be translated adverbially (‘diestramente, hábilmente, magistralmente’).
In reality, according to the reconstruction of Sciumbata, complements of
means and manner are involved, in which the artistic-technical lexical
unit is implied (‘with his ingenuity’, ‘according to their ingenuity’).

<b>A.1</b>  ἀνδρεία/ἀνδρία, which renders  <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in Prov 21:30, also translates
 <span dir="rtl">כִּשְׁרוֹן</span> in Qoh 2:21; 4:4; 5:10.


<b>A.2</b>  ἔννοια also translates  <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מְזִמָּה</span>, and 
<span dir="rtl">שׂכל</span>. The use of the
word to render  <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in Prov 2:11 is probably due to the attempt to
find a synonym for <span dir="rtl">מְזִמָּה</span> which occurs in the first hemistich of the verse.


<b>A.3</b>  ἐπιστήμη also translates 
<span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">דֵּעַ</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">דֵּעָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מַדָע</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">הַשְֹכֵּיל</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂ֫כֶל</span>, and 
<span dir="rtl">שִׂכְלוּת</span>. 
Though ἐπιστήμη too may be used in an artistic-technical
context as well as an epistemological one, its exploitation to translate <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in the meaning ‘ingenuity’ is partial. The substantive, which is used in Job 12:12, is not repeated in Job 12:13 (where σύνεσις is used).


<span id="AVLA4"><b>A.4</b></span>
 The rendering of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> by λόγος in Prov 5:1 is interesting (Pesh
here depends on the Greek). In this verse  <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> is the designation for
the word of the teacher (‘incline your ear to my intelligence’; Sciumbata 1996-97:160). It would be a matter of the individual intuition of a translator, seeing that the fact is not repeated in the other occurrences of the same type. The same phenomenon is however, encountered with νουθέτησις in Prov 2:2 and with παιδεία in Sir 4:24.

<b>A.5</b>  In Prov 2:2b νουθέτησις occurs twice, inasmuch as the hemistich is divided into two synonymous phrases. The Greek term does not translate any other Hebrew substantives.

<b>A.6</b>  In Sir 4:24 παιδεία seems to be an attempt to provide a synonym for <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> in the first hemistich of the verse.

<b>A.7</b>  σοφία also translates 
<span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מוּסָר</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מַחֲשֶׁ֫בֶת</span>, and 
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂ֫כֶל</span>.


<b>A.8</b>  σύνεσις also translates 
<span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">נָבוּן</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">הָבִין</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">גְּבוּרה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מַדָע</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מִנְדַּע</span>,
<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">הַשְֹכֵּיל</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂ֫כֶל</span>, and 
<span dir="rtl">מַשְׂכִּיל</span>. The substantive is also used, though not uniformly, for the lexeme <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in its artistic-technical sense.


<b>A.9</b>  φρόνησις also translates 
<span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מַדָע</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">מִנָדַּע</span>,

<span dir="rtl">לֵב</span>,

<span dir="rtl">רוּחַ</span>,
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂ֫כֶל</span>, and 
<span dir="rtl">הַשׂכֵּיל</span>. In Prov 19:8 it occurs twice, inasmuch as it also renders
 <span dir="rtl">לֵב</span>.


<b>A.10</b> ἀνὴρ φρόνιμος[^6] translates the syntagm 
<span dir="rtl">אִישׁ תְּבוּנָה/תְּבוּנוֹת</span>.

<b>A.11</b> As can be seen, <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> is rendered in the LXX by at least nine different substantives (for the cases of textual uncertainty see below), the larger part of which are used in their turn to translate other terms from the lexical field of knowledge or from the wisdom lexicon. However, the most frequent translation is by σύνεσις and φρόνησις, the only words that are used in the versions of Aquila, Theodotion and Symmachus (the last with two exceptions).


<b>A.12</b>  The parallel texts Jer 10:12 and 51:15 are translated differently, respectively with φρόνησις and σύνεσις.

<b>A.13</b> There is a textual problem in 
Hos 13:2, where κατ’εἰκόνα εἰδώλων appears for Heb. <span dir="rtl">כִּתְבוּנָם</span>.  
The rendering presupposes a Vorlage  <span dir="rtl">תַּבְנִית</span>, as a simplification of a <i>lectio difficilior</i> which was not understood
(see above <a href="#InGTA2">Introduction A.2</a> and <a href="#TDB1">Introduction: Text Doubtful B.1</a>).

<span id="AVLA14"><b>A.14</b></span> 
There is also a textual problem in Prov 28:16, where the Greek diverges from the MT: the reading προσόδων presupposes <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּאוֹת</span>, ‘revenue’.

<span id="AVLA15"><b>A.15</b></span>
There is also a textual problem in Sir 14:21. Here LXX has ἐν τοῖς ἀποκρύφοις, ‘in her secrets’ for Heb. <span dir="rtl">ובתבונותיה</span>. Taking account of the rendering of Pesh for this passage <span dir="rtl">ܫܒܝܠܐ</span> (<i>šbilā’</i>, see below), Segal (1958:93) maintains that the correct Hebrew reading should be <span dir="rtl">בנתיבותיה</span>, ‘on her paths’
(<span dir="rtl">תבונותיה</span> would be a corruption due to the influence of the previous verse). The Greek should hence have ἀτραποῖς (the translation of <span dir="rtl">נְתִיבוֹת</span dir="rtl"> in Job 24:13), which was in its turn the object of textual corruption.


<b>A.16</b>  In Sir 15:15 πίστις presupposes <span dir="rtl">אמונה</span>, a reading which does not fit
the context (Segal 1958:96).


<b>b. Aquila (αʹ)</b>:

* φρόνησις, ‘practical wisdom, prudence in government and affairs’: Deut 32:28; Isa 40:14; Pss 48:4; 78:72 (=77:72); Prov 2:11; 18:2.

<b>A.1</b>  The fact that in all the attestations of Aquila which we have  <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> is translated by φρόνησις, unless it is to be attributed to chance, conforms to the desire of this translation to keep close to the original language.


<b>c. Symmachus (σʹ)</b>:

* κρίσις, ‘separating, distinguishing decision, judgement’: Isa 40:14;
* σύνεσις, ‘faculty of quick comprehension, sagacity’: Ezek 28:4; Ps 48:4; Prov 28:16;
* φρόνησις, ‘practical wisdom, prudence in government and affairs’: Isa 40:14; Ps 78:72 (=77:72); Prov 2:11;
* No translation equivalent: Job 32:11.

<b>A.1</b>  In Isa 40:14 two renderings by Symmachus seem to be attested (κρίσις and φρόνησις).

<b>A.2</b>  In Job 32:11 Symmachus has ἐφρονεῖτε.


<b>d. Theodotion (θʹ)</b>:

* σύνεσις, ‘faculty of quick comprehension, sagacity’: Ezek 28:4; Pss 48:4; 78:72 (=77:72); Prov 8:1; Job 32:11;
* φρόνησις, ‘practical wisdom, prudence in government and affairs’: Isa 40:14; Prov 2:11; 5:1.

<b>A.1</b>  In the Pesh <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> is most frequently rendered by <span dir="rtl">ܣܘܟܠܐ</span> (<i>sukkālāʾ </i>). Also
connected to this same lexeme are <span dir="rtl">ܣܟܘܠܬܢܐ</span> (<i>sakkultānāʾ </i>) and <span dir="rtl">ܣܟܘܠܬܢܘܬܐ</span> (<i>sakkultānutāʾ </i>).

<b>A.2</b>  In Prov 2:3 <span dir="rtl">ܣܘܟܠܐ</span> (<i>sukkālāʾ </i>) occurs twice, as the translation both of <span dir="rtl">בינה</span> and of <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span>.

<b>A.3</b>  <span dir="rtl">ܚܟܡܬܐ</span> (<i>ḥekmtāʾ </i>), ‘sapientia’ is for Brockelmann (LS) an autonomous lexeme vis-à-vis the m. <span dir="rtl">ܚܟܡܬܐ</span> (<i>ḥekmtāʾ </i>) ‘παιδεία eruditio’. Less correctly Payne Smith 141-142 considers <span dir="rtl">ܚܟܡܬܐ</span> (<i>ḥekmtāʾ </i>) the emphatic form of <span dir="rtl">ܚܟܡܐ</span> (<i>ḥekmāʾ </i>), ‘wisdom, counsel’, with a difference of meaning vis-à-vis the absolute.

<b>A.4</b>  In Prov 5:1 the use of <span dir="rtl">ܡܐܡܪܐ</span> (<i>mēʾmrāʾ </i>) probably depends on the λόγος of the LXX (see above <a href="#AVLA4">LXX A.4</a>).

<b>A.5</b>  Isa 44:19 has <span dir="rtl">ܐܬܪܥ݂ܝܘ</span> (<i>ʾetra‘‘iu</i>), ‘have thought’. The phrase has been changed in Syriac.

<b>A.6</b>  Prov 19:8 has <span dir="rtl">ܗܝܡܢܘܬܐ</span> (<i>haymānutāʾ </i>), ‘truth, faithfulness’.

<b>A.7</b>  The adjective <span dir="rtl">ܚܟܝܡ</span> (<i>ḥakkim</i>) translates the syntagms <span dir="rtl">אִישׁ תְּבוּנָה</span> and 
<span dir="rtl">רַב־תְּבוּנָה</span>.

<b>A.8</b>  Hos 13:2 has <span dir="rtl">ܕܡܘܬܐ</span> (<i>dmutāʾ </i>), ‘form, shape, figure’; cf. <a href="#InGTA2">Introduction A.2</a> and <a href="#TDB1">Introduction: Text Doubtful B.1</a>.

<b>A.9</b>  In Sir 14:21 <span dir="rtl">ܫܒܝ̈ܠܐ</span> (<i>šbileʾ </i>), ‘paths’, occurs (pl. of <span dir="rtl">ܫܒܝܠܐ</span>  \[<i>šbilāʾ </i>]), which for Segal (1958:93) represents the correct Hebrew reading (<span dir="rtl">בנתיבותיה</span>); see above <a href="#AVLA15">LXX A.15</a>.

<b>A.10</b>  In Sir 44:3 the phrase is completely rewritten, but <span dir="rtl">ܣܟܘܠܬܢܘܬܗܘܢ</span> (<i>sakkultānuthon</i>) seems to correspond perfectly to <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.

<b>A.11</b>  Sir 45:5 has <span dir="rtl">ܒܘܪܟܬܐ</span> (<i>burktāʾ </i>), ‘blessing’ (in the text in the pl. <span dir="rtl">ܒܘܪ̈ܟܬܐ</span> \[<i>burkātāʾ </i>]).

<span id="AVfTA4"><b>A.4</b></span> 
The targumic renderings are particularly significant:  
a) <span dir="rtl">בינא</span>/<span dir="rtl">בינתא</span> (it could be a loan from the Hebrew to translate
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> as designations of wisdom instruction) re-echoes the post-exilic substitution of Hebrew <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> for <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.   
b) The other lexeme which replaces <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in LBH is <span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span>, cognate of the Aram. <span dir="rtl">סוכלתנו</span> (and the Aramaic could be a contributing factor for that replacement, in addition to other influences internal to the linguistic structure).   
c) The exceptional rendering by  <span dir="rtl">מנדעה</span>, ‘knowledge’, in 11QTgJob at Job 26:12 should be noted.

<b>A.1</b>  The most frequent Latin equivalent is <i>prudentia</i>.

<b>A.2</b>  The syntagm <span dir="rtl">אִישׁ תְּבוּנָה</span> is translated by the adjective <i>prudens</i> 
(for the most part <i>vir prudens</i>) or <i>sapiens</i> (<i>homo sapiens</i> in Prov 20:5).

<b>A.3</b>  The different treatment reserved for  <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> in Job 12:12-13 in LXX also appears in Vg, where it is translated respectively by
<i>prudentia</i> and <i>intelligentia</i>.

<b>A.4</b>  In Isa 44:19 the phrase
<span dir="rtl">וְלֹא דַעַת וְלֹא־תְבוּנָה</span> becomes <i>neque cognoscunt neque sentiunt</i>, with the correspondence between the substantive <span dir="rtl">דַעַת</span> and the verb <i>cognoscunt</i> on the one hand and of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> with the verb <i>sentiunt</i>, ‘to perceive (physically and mentally)’, on the other.

<b>A.5</b>  In Sir 4:24 (=4:29) three Latin words correspond to  <span dir="rtl">תבונה</span> (<i>et
sensus et scientia et doctrina</i>).

<b>A.6</b>  The translation of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> by <i>disciplina</i> in Sir 45:5 catches the
designative level of the lexeme, which refers to the words taught by the wisdom teacher.

<b>A.7</b>  For the translation <i>quasi similitudinem idolorum</i> in Hos 13:2, cf. above <a href="#InGTA2">Introduction A.2</a> and <a href="#TDB1">Itroduction: Text Doubtful B.1</a>.

<b>A.8</b>  The translation <i>et in absconsis illius</i> in Sir 14:21 clearly depends on the Greek text; see above <a href="#AVLA14">LXX A.14</a>.


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<span id="LSFA1"><b> 
A.1</b></span>  In the work on structural semantics (carried out following the methodology elaborated by the Romanian linguist Eugenio Coseriu) which Sciumbata (1996-97) has devoted to the lexical field of the substantives for ‘knowledge’ and to the reciprocal relations and linguistic boundaries between the lexemes in the paradigmatic structure, the semantic specificity of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and the history of its diachronic vitality have been precisely identified.  
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’, is located at the positive pole of the lexical
field and hence enters into polar opposition with 
<span dir="rtl">פְּתַיּוּת</span>, ‘silliness, lack of knowledge’, 
<span dir="rtl">תִּפְלָה</span>, ‘senselessness, irrationality’, and 
<span dir="rtl">כְּסִילוּת</span>, ‘obtuseness’. This last is its exact polar opposite in that it expresses
the lack of the mental faculty which is open to knowledge, understood on the theoretical-speculative level, that is to say as information which is possessed or learned. There is not a direct antonymy with <span dir="rtl">פֶּ֫תִי</span>, ‘silliness, lack of education’, insofar as this lexeme belongs to the jargon of the didactic-sapiential strand. As for <span dir="rtl">הוֹלֵלוֹת/הוֹלֵלוּת</span>, ‘insipience,
ignorance’, 
<span dir="rtl">שִׂכְלוּת/סִכְלוּת</span>, ‘stupidity’, 
<span dir="rtl">סֶכֶל</span>, ‘stupidity’, 
<span dir="rtl">כֶּסֶל</span> II, ‘obtuseness’, lexemes are involved which Sciumbata maintains are
coinages of Qoheleth. He makes a refinement of the language in this domain, to exhibit without ambiguity the central issue implicit in his book, namely the epistemological polemic against the traditional strand of the sapiential movement (cf. Sciumbata 1996). Qohelet achieves this goal by avoiding the lexicon connected with the sapiential current against which he polemizes: these lexemes are not opposed paradigmatically to <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, because this latter has no living use in post-exilic times.   
The positive pole of the lexical field is structured (even if not in all the functional languages) on three dimensions, lexical sub-groups characterised by a common semic feature. The dimensions (theoretical-speculative, pragmatic-behavioural and methodological) represent three ways in which the feature ‘knowledge’ is understood in ancient Hebrew. The theoretical-speculative dimension, a semic feature
shared by <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’, understands knowledge as a theoretical matter, which can be expressed in the form of information or faculties
(thus giving rise to two further lexical sub-divisions: see below). Hence
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> is opposed to the group of lexemes characterised by the feature
‘pragmatic-behavioural dimension’, in which the seme ‘knowledge’ is understood as the possession of a quality which guides one to act (involved are 
<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, ‘wisdom’, 
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span>, ‘judgement, sense, good sense’,
<span dir="rtl">הַשְֹכֵּ(י)ל</span> ‘judgement, sense, good sense’, 
<span dir="rtl">עָרְמָה</span>, ‘shrewdness’, 
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span>, ‘wisdom’), and to the group characterised by the feature ‘methodological
dimension’, in which knowledge is taken as an aim to reach (for the substantives this dimension is poorly developed and concerns only <span dir="rtl">חֵקֶר</span>,  ‘investigation’, a poetic word).  
As has been said, within the group of lexemes which belong to the theoretical-speculative dimension there is a further sub-division between those characterised by the feature ‘information’ 
(<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, ‘wisdom (= learning)’, 
<span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span>, ‘knowledge’, 
<span dir="rtl">דֵּעָה</span>, ‘knowledge’, 
<span dir="rtl">מַדָע</span>, ‘knowledge’,
<span dir="rtl">לֶקַח</span>, ‘instruction’) and those characterised by the feature ‘faculties’:
among these latter <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> ‘intelligence’ is located. Among the
faculties some are understood (‘marked’) by the functions they display
and others by the effect which their possession produces: <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, which
is a cognitive faculty of the functional kind, is therefore opposed from this point of view to 
<span dir="rtl">טַעַם</span>, ‘reason’, and 
<span dir="rtl">תּוּשִׁיָּה/תֻּשִׁיָּה</span>, ‘acumen, lucidity of
thought, farsightedness’. The remaining semes peculiar to the substantive are of being an intellectual faculty which is ‘general’ and ‘of understanding’.   
To summarise, <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’, indicates the intellectual faculty of man which allows him to understand. Its most immediate antonym, in EBH, is <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, ‘discernment’ (intellectual faculty of perception and
distinction), which, even when it neutralises some of its features by indicating ‘intelligence’ generally retains traces of this identity. If some trials of interchange between <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> are made in different contexts in EBH, the difference of the semantic intentionality conveyed will quickly be noticed. Only in one case (Prov 2:3, a text which is a true and typical inventory of the sapiential lexicon) do <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> occur in the same context, effectively as synonyms.   
For other lexemes <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> which belong to specialised languages (sub-systems), see below <a href="#Ex">Exegesis</a>.

<span id="LSFA2"><b> 
A.2</b></span> In the research developed by Sciumbata 1996-97 the diachronic vitality of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> is also delineated, on the basis of the following considerations:[^7]   
a) <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> has a major distribution in EBH (36 occurrences). Here it appears already in ABH and in the poetic as well as the narrative layers of the language. In LBH there are five attestations, poetic or
poetic-sapiential. For the rest, the relatively high frequency in Ben Sira (8x) is counter-balanced by the almost total absence from Qumran Hebrew (1x).  
b) In many post-exilic texts the meanings and the constructions of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> are inherited by <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span>, which occur in the contexts
in which EBH would have used <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.  
c) A general late morphological substitution is attested between the <i>taqtul</i> on one side and <i>qi:l/qu:l</i> on the other (fem. forms: cf. Bendavid 1967-71, 2:445, §28). The replacement of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> by <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> ends by becoming automatic even for quotations (CD 5:17, 4Q504 8
recto 5), and is particularly clear in technical-craft and creation contexts (2 Chron 2:12; Job 38:4; 39:26; 4Q503 51-55 1 3). Among other
things, <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> which previously had a poetic character clearly became a more common term in the post-exilic texts.   
d) Close examination of the attestations of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in LBH gives the following results:   

1. In Job the meanings and the contexts of the four occurrences show that the choice of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> is due either to the imitation of the terminology of the wisdom groups to which the three friends belong or to a stereotypical <i>cliché</i> in the context of references to creation. A comparison with the diffusion of <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> in the book (9 occurrences) and a careful scrutiny of its meanings and constructions (not attested in EBH, but shared with other post-exilic texts) reveals that the author of the poem has accepted the morphological and semantic substitution between the two terms.
2. Ps 147:5 is a reminiscence of Isa 40:28. The general context is related to creation which explains the choice of a lexeme which was by now obsolete. 
3. In Sira the frequency of the attestations is explicable by his adherence to the literary genre of Proverbs to which he aspires and by the patina of archaism which the term secures for him. Ben Sira takes great care to avoid the automatic replacement of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> by <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, which is encountered in other post-exilic texts, so much so that he seems to commit an error of hypercorrection in 15:15a, where he defines with <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> the legal <i>corpus</i> of Israel which in Deut 4:6 (a text which is equally late) is defined by <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>.
4. The unique Qumran attestation is in reality a quotation of Jer 10:12 and Ps 136:5.

e) The comparison with Qohelet is illuminating: in contrast to Ben Sira he is in polemic against the didactic and traditionalist groups and in contrast to the author of the poem of Job he does not imitate them even for the sake of a literary stratagem: in his lexicon there is no longer any place for <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.  
f) The comparison with the frequency which the other lexemes of the lexical field have in the Qumran texts compared to the biblical text (in particular <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span> should be observed) excludes the suspicion that the lack of attestations may be due to a lack of thematic opportunity.  
g) Only <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> has less occurrences in the Qumran texts, and in fact it is a matter of another lexeme which loses active life after the exile.   
In summary, from the distribution of the occurrences and from the analysis of their character it is concluded that <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> (in all its meanings) belongs to the lexical structure of EBH, where it appears in the narrative register as well as in the poetic one (beginning already
in ABH). The two post-exilic authors who use it (the author of the poem of Job and Ben Sira) make a scholarly salvage operation, from among the most frequently occurring lexicon in the wisdom literature, lexicon that is connected to the issues developed by the intellectual tradition, like the problem of knowledge, the ways of obtaining it and its relations with faith in the God of Israel. As for Ps 147:5 and 11Q5 26:14 they are
rather some stereotypical <i>clichés</i> on God the creator, which drag <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> behind them, as mnemonic remembrance. The heirs of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in LBH are <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span> (and then the translation with <span dir="rtl">בינא</span>, <span dir="rtl">ביונא</span> and <span dir="rtl">סוכלתנו</span> in the Targumim is not by chance).  
In the Mishnah there is only a single attestation of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>: Abot 2:7, where it is probable that the lexeme has been called up by the
didactic-sapiential aura of the saying:
<span dir="rtl">מרבה ישׁיבה מרבה חכמה מרבה עצה מרבה תבונה</span>, ‘the more schooling the more wisdom, the more counsel the more understanding’ (Danby).

<b>B.1</b>  The Targumim treat <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> as synonyms. They translate them normally with <span dir="rtl">סוכלתנו</span> and derived forms, while in the wisdom texts (with an implicit recognition of the peculiarity of the meanings which come into play) they have recourse to a loan or calque from Hebrew: <span dir="rtl">ביונא</span>.

<b>B.2</b>  Regarding 1 Kgs 5:9, the statement of Gray (1977:146) turns out to be totally unfounded, when he says that <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">רֹחַב לֵב</span> (which is a hapax) appear only in late sources, a fact which together with other
factors makes him think of a late dating for the passage in question.

<span id="Ex">
## 6. Exegesis</span>

<span id="ExA1"><b>A.1</b></span>
The meanings reconstructed for <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in ancient Hebrew, in the
light of the structuration and functioning of the whole lexical field of
the substantives for ‘knowledge’, are the following (Sciumbata
1996-97:153-70; 319-22; 394-95):
<span dir="rtl">תְּבוּן</span>, ‘ingenuity’: Hos 13:2. It is possible that we are dealing with a
dialectal variant of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.

1. <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>1</sub></small>, ‘intelligence’ (intellectual faculty whose function is to allow one to understand). Occurrences: Deut 32:28; 1 Kgs 5:9; Isa 44:19; Obad 1:7, 8; Prov 2:6; 10:23; 11:12; 14:29; 15:21; 17:27; 18:2; 20:5; 21:30; Job 12:13; Sir 4:24<small><sup>A</sup></small>; 44:3<small><sup>B,Mas</sup></small>. The clear-cut distinction of meaning from <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> should be noted, to understand the reasons for lexical choices made by the authors in the various contexts. Thus, in Deut 32:28 (<span dir="rtl">כִּי־גוֹי אֹבַד ‏עֵצוֹת הֵמָּה‏ וְאֵין בָּהֶם תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘since they are a nation which has lost its sense, and there is not in them any intelligence’) it is not a matter of ‘discernment’ (NJPS, which also translates in this way elsewhere), namely a faculty of perception or distinction, but of the faculty of understanding (what is to be done: cf. also Zorell 887, whose definitions ‘animadversio, attentio... habitus seu virtus animadvertendi animadvertenda’ seem to be misguided by the etymological lens with which the meaning is interpreted).
2. <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>2</sub></small>, ‘ingenuity, genius’ (mental, creative faculty in handicraft and art: we are dealing with a usage of the specialized language of the technical artisan sector). Occurrences: Exod 31:3; 35:31; 36:1; 1 Kgs 7:14; Isa 40:28; Jer 10:12; Ezek 28:4; Pss 136:5; 147:5; Prov 3:19; Job 26:12; 11Q5 26:14.  The artisan-technical linguistic context which is typical of this lexeme is clear in the narrative occurrences in Exodus and Kings. The poetic language of Prophets, Psalms and Proverbs uses it in creation contexts, making a parallel between the artistic genius or cleverness of man and that of God.[^8] The creation context becomes topical for <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, to such an extent that it is the principal cause of its recovery in late Hebrew, down to the Qumran texts. In Hos 13:2  the lexeme appears in the masculine <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּן</span>. 
This technical meaning, even if not recognised as specifically sector-related, is noted by all the lexica (and by the modern translations), though not always in its precise nuance. Schökel speaks of ‘destreza, habilidad, maestría, pericia’ (<i>DBHE</i>, 792); Ringgren 1973:628, ‘Geschicklichkeit im Beruf’ (linking to it Hos 13:2 as well); <i>HAL</i>, 1548, ‘Geschick’.[^9]  An exception is represented by Benno Jacob (1992:842): ‘Bezalel possessed the gift of orignality, a divine inspiration here defined as the ability to visualise and execute’.   
The professional technicalisation of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> (like other terms too of
the lexicon of ‘knowledge’) occurs also in other contexts: song in Chronicles, medicine in Ben Sira.
3. <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>, ‘intelligence’ (lexeme of the didactic-wisdom jargon, designating the corpus of instructions and values taught by that tradition). Occurrences: Prov 2:2; 5:1; Sir 14:20<small><sup>A</sup></small>, 21<small><sup>A</sup></small>; 15:3<small><sup>A,B</sup></small>; 15:15<small><sup>A</sup></small>; 45:5<small><sup>B</sup></small>. The reference is to the teachings and the words of the teacher, mostly of an ethical-behavioural kind. In the jargon of the traditionalist sapiential strand many other lexemes of the lexical field of ‘knowledge’ undergo this treatment (the same applies to <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>4</sub></small> and <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>5</sub></small>), obliterating the semantic peculiarity of each one: the superimposed technical sense is prevalent. The translation by <span dir="rtl">ביונא</span> in the Targumim on the wisdom texts, a term which can be considered as a loan from the Hebrew (see above <a href="#AVfTA4">Ancient Versions: Targum A.4</a>)
and which is equally used in the same contexts for <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, seems to render this technical development which is basically untranslatable.
4. <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>4</sub></small>, ‘intelligence’ (lexeme of the didactic-wisdom jargon, designating a virtue obtained by training with the teachers of the current, understood to take the place of the natural faculty of man). Occurrences Prov 2:3, 11; 3:13; 19:8; 24:3; Job 12:12. There is here a lack of distinction from <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> with the same meaning.
5. <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>5</sub></small>, ‘Intelligence’ (name given <i>tout court</i> to the metaphysicalization of the teaching of the didactic-traditional sapiential current; an identical phenomenon happens with <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>). Occurrence: Prov 8:1. According to Dahood (1970), the personification of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> appears also in Ps 136:5. In reality we have repeated the <i>cliché</i> on the creation of the heavens thanks to divine ingenuity/genius.
6. <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span><small><sub>6</sub></small>, ‘intelligent manifestations, actions, words etc’. The semantic transition of the plural to indicate the effects or the manifestations of the concept expressed by the singular noun occurs also with <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> (for this phenomenon, cf. Joüon-Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §136g; Fox 1993:152). Occurrences: Pss 49:4; 78:72; Job 32:11; Sir 50:27<small><sup>B</sup></small>.

<b>A.2</b> Michael Fox has made some attempts at a definition of the meaning of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, also in opposition to <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>:  
> One may have <i>tebunah</i> and do things in <i>tebunah</i>, but <i>tebunah</i> is not an action done to something. (Fox 1993:151)   

> <i>tebunah</i> designates the pragmatic, applied aspect of thought operating in the field of action; it aims at efficacy and accomplishment. <i>Binah</i> is the conceptual, interpretive activity of
thought, operating in the field of meaning; it aims at perception and comprehension. (Fox 1993:152) 
 
A little later he maintains that it is a matter rather of common sense than of the exercise of the intellect. Despite the vagueness and confusion of these statements, Fox’s is one of the few serious attempts to provide descriptions of the meaning of the lexicon of ‘knowledge’ on the linguistic level, without confusing it with a summary of the connections, equivalences and contextual senses. Its
explicit attempt to escape from the fetters of contextual descriptions of meaning fails nevertheless for the lack of a rigorous method of linguistic research.

<b>A.3</b>  William McKane (1970) shows a fine semantic sensibility in regard to the lexicon of knowledge. In his reconstruction of the wisdom movement he speaks of the lexicon of ancient wisdom which is resemanticised in the book in a religious sense. Independently of the validity of this reconstruction, the semantic definitions often hit the nail on the head. He describes <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in Chapter 2 of the book as ‘mental virtues of sagacity and penetration, inculcated by an educational process which addressed itself to the right shaping and
maturing of intellectual attitudes’ (McKane 1970:281).

<b>B.1</b>  The distinctions made by Rashi between <span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>, <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, and <span dir="rtl">דַּעַת</span> in the manual contexts of Exodus are of a rationalistic (and in part theological) kind. In the comment on Exod 31:3 regarding <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> he says:
<span dir="rtl">מבין דבר מלבו מתוכ דברימ שׁלמד</span>, ‘it would be a matter namely of the capacity to draw conclusions on the basis of learned knowledge’. Umberto Cassuto (1967:402) is located on the same line when he specifies that it is a matter of ‘the capacity to deduce one thing from another and to find a way of solving any problem that may arise in the course of the work’. It is curious that Rashi does not mention in this context the technical use which is made of the three terms, since in the comment in Prov 3:19 he recognises the agreement between the three faculties which God uses there and those of Bezalel in Exodus and of Hiram in 1 Kgs 7:14.

<b>B.2</b>  BDB treats many of the words of the lexical field according to an identical scheme. For <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> (and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>) it distinguishes three applications (BDB, 108): 1) the act; 2) the faculty; 3) the object of knowledge. A fourth meaning is given, with the personification of the
term (cf. also Gordis 1978 on Job 32:11). This division does not grasp, except partially, the real lexematic articulation of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>.

<b>B.3</b>  <i>HAL</i>, 1548, limits itself to the provision of ‘glosses’ or ‘labels’ in the German language (‘Einsicht, Klugheit, Geschick’), which turn out to be rather vague and do not allow the identification of the specific semantic content of the lexeme with respect to other ‘synonyms’.

<b>B.4</b>  Zorell, ‘<i>animadversio, attentio, habitus seu virtus animadvertendi animadvertenda, prudentia, intelligentia</i>’ (887), seems to have been carried off course in his definitions by the attempt to describe
the meaning according to the etymological perspective.

<b>B.5</b>  It is a practice of many commentators and lexicographers to speak of a connection with wisdom thought (see as a representative Ringgren 1973:628). In
reality <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> (like the other terms of its lexical field) belongs to
the everyday language (Whybray 1974; Fox 1993; Sciumbata 1996-97 and
1999) and only for thematic reasons does it recur in the so-called
wisdom texts. If in certain circles the practice was established of
defining with the lexemes of the lexical field of ‘knowledge’ a given
<i>corpus</i> of teaching, the contents of this <i>corpus</i> cannot be identified
<i>tout court</i> with its linguistic meaning.

## 7. Conclusions

In the semantic reconstruction provided by Sciumbata 1996-97, it is concluded that <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, in all its meanings (see <a href="#ExA1">Exegesis A.1</a>),
belongs to the vocabulary of pre-exilic Hebrew, where it appears in the
narrative register as well as in poetry. The post-exilic occurrences are
due to the recovery (polemical in Job, from imitation in Ben Sira) of
the didactic-wisdom terminology, or to stereotypical <i>clichés</i> related
to creation. The reasons for the decline of <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span> in late Hebrew are
to be seen in the morphological replacement of the pattern <i>taqtul</i> on
the one hand by <i>qi:l/qu:l</i> on the other. Its uses and its semantic
content are taken up in LBH by <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> and <span dir="rtl">שֶׂכֶל</span>.


<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">תְּבוּנָה</span>, ‘intelligence’, and <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span>, ‘discernment, intelligence’, are
not interchangeable synonyms. Apart from a different viewpoint on the
semantic information which they transmit they are distinguished by their
different distribution: <span dir="rtl">בִּינָה</span> is in standard Hebrew a poetic term, and
only in the post-exilic period does it descend into the language of
prose.

[^1]: Cf. <i>BHS</i>; <i>HAL</i>, 1549; Harper 1905:395; Cathcart and Gordon 1989:58.
[^2]: Mandelkern erroneously gives the <span dir="rtl">ו</span> for Job 32:11 in his concordance.
[^3]: For the functional languages, see Sciumbata 1996-97:153-54; and the <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a> above.
[^4]: Cf. Fox 1993:51, who discerns a reflexive meaning in the lexeme.

[^6]: Absent in HRCS<sup><small>1</small></sup> and noted in HRCS<sup><small>2</small></sup>.
[^7]: Sciumbata applied the dating criteria for linguistic phenomena defined by Avi Hurvitz; cf. Hurvitz 1982 and 1995.
[^8]: Already the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Berakot</i> 55a, made a connection between the three gifts made by God to Bezalel and the same three qualities which according to Prov 3:19-20 God displayed at the moment of creation; see also Rashi on Prov 3:19.
[^9]: Whybray (1974) seems undecided: on p 138 he speaks of ‘manual skill’, while on p 139 of ‘creative skill such as that of an artificer’.
