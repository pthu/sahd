## Introduction

Grammatical type: noun masc. <br>
Occurrences: 3x HB (0/2/1); 1x Sir; 0x Qum; 0x Inscr.  (Total: 4)
 
* Nebiim: Judg 3:25; Isa 22:22.
* Ketubim: 1 Chron 9:27;
* Sira: 42:6<small><sup>Mas</sup></small> (see A.1).

<b>A.1</b>
Sir 42:6 in the Masada scroll contains the word
<span dir="rtl">מפתח</span>, which may mean ‘key’.
Instead, Ms B reads <span dir="rtl">תפתח</span>. The Masada Hebrew text runs:  
<!--Op basis van bensira.org; zie ook DCH-->
<span dir="rtl">[על אשה רעה ת]שׄת חותם</span>
‘[... wield]s a seal’,    
<span dir="rtl">ומקום ידים רבות מפתח</span> 
‘or (concerning) a place (where) many hands (hold) a key’.  
The reading in Ms B is different:  
<span dir="rtl">על אשה רעה <טפשה> חותם׃ חכם</span>
‘Of putting a seal upon an unworthy <imprident> wife, wise’ [ ]  
<span dir="rtl">ומקום ידים רפות תפתח</span> 
‘or of opening the place where hands are weak’.



## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> 
<i>Root:</i> 
<span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span> is a <i>maqtil</i> form of <span dir="rtl">פתח</span>, ‘to open’,[^1]
which is common in most Semitic languages.[^2] Below only relatively close correspondences are noted. 
In BHeb. the noun is masc.,[^4] but Rosenberg shows that in the Talmud[^5] it is 
sometimes fem. (mss. Ven. and Lowe, 
respectively).[^5] 


<b>A.2</b>
<i>Akkadian:</i>
Even though the etymologically related verb <i>petû</i> is often used with doors and gates, its derivatives <i>naptētu</i> ‘key, small saw’ and <i>naptû</i> ‘part of a lock’ occur in lexical texts only.[^9] The normal word for ‘key’ in Akkadian is <i>namzaqu</i>.

<b>A.3</b>
<i>Ugaritic:</i>
In a scribal exercise <i>mptẖ</i>, ‘key’, occurs.[^10] 

<b>A.4</b>
<i>Postbiblical Hebrew:</i>
<span dir="rtl">מפתח</span> ‘key’.[^11]

<b>A.5</b>
<i>Jewish Aramaic:</i>
<span dir="rtl">מפתח</span> ‘key’.[^12]

<b>A.6</b>
<i>Classical Arabic:</i>
<i>miftaḥ</i>, <i>miftāḥ</i> ‘key, instrument for opening’.[^13]

<b>A.7</b>
<i>Modern South Arabic:</i>
Soqoṭri <i>miftāḥ</i> ‘key’;[^14] 
Mehri <i>mȩftēḥ</i> ‘key’;[^15]
Jibbāli <i>muftȩḥ</i> ‘key’.[^16]

<b>A.7</b>
<i>Modern Palestinian Arabic:</i>
<i>muftāḥ</i> ‘key’.[^17]

<b>A.8</b>
<i>Ethiopic:</i>
Geez <i>maftȩḥ</i> ‘instrument for opening (key)’.[^18]

<a id="rab"></a><b>A.9</b>
<i>Rabbinical literature:</i>
Isa 22:22 underlies the crucial (‘key’-)text Matt 
16:19 and similar texts about binding and 
unbinding in the N.T. (see <a href="#Fig">6.2. Figurative Use</a>).[^20] <br>
Apart from the citation in Rev 3:7, the ‘keys of 
Death and Hades’ are mentioned in Rev 1:18, and 
the ‘key of the (pit [φρέαρ] of the) Abyssos (‘bottomless pit’, RSV)’ in Rev 9:1, 20:1, cf. 
Hen 42 Rec B.[^21] See also Luke 11:52 ‘you have taken 
away the key of knowledge’.[^22] Three 
keys are reserved exclusively for God (or his 
messenger, who are one, m. Ber. V.5): that for rain 
(cf. Deut 28:12 ‘The Lord will open to you his 
good treasury, the heavens, etc.’ ; 1 Kgs 17:1; 
18:1 [Elijah]: ‘when the heaven was shut up three 
years and six months’, Luke 4:25); that for birth 
(cf. Gen 30:22 [Rachel]); and that for raising 
from death (cf. 1 Kgs 17:17; Ezek 37:13).[^23] <br>
As for 1 Chron 9:27, Dalman quotes m. Tam. 
I.1: the elder priests slept in the heating room 
of the sanctuary with the keys of the inner 
temple court in their hands. The door of the 
temple was opened with golden keys.[^24] <br>
The lock on a front door belonged to the house and was sold together with it, but the key was kept with the furniture.[^25] The lock has a case (<span dir="rtl">בית</span>), with a bolt or bar (<span dir="rtl">נגר</span>), in which the key (<span dir="rtl">מפתח</span>) could be stuck (shoven?).[^26] The key has taps (<span dir="rtl">חפים</span>) and holes (<span dir="rtl">נקבים</span>); with these the pins of the case, that fitted in the corresponding holes of the 
bolt/bar could be removed, so that the door could 
be opened.[^27]               

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b> 
<span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span> is a <i>maqtil</i> form of <span dir="rtl">פתח</span>, ‘to open’;
see BL 492 rζ.
In Isa 22:22 the stat. 
cstr. is <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span>, not <span dir="rtl">מַפְתַּח</span>, as would be expected (dissimilation?[^3]). 


## 3. Syntagmatics

[Discussion will be added later.]

## <a id="AV"></a>4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions (αʹ, σʹ, θʹ)</b>:  

* κλεῖδα, ‘key’: Judg 3:25 (sing.); 1 Chron 9:27 (plur.).
* δόξα, ‘glory’: Isa 22:22 (see A.1)


<b>b.  Peshitta (Pesh):</b>  

* <span dir="rtl">ܐܩ̈ܠܝܕܐ</span>/<span dir="rtl">ܩ̈ܠܝܕܐ</span> (<i>(ʾa)qlidè</i> < κλείς), ‘keys’: Judg 3:25; Isa 22:22 (both with <i>s<sup>e</sup>yamē</i>, thus plur.; in Judg 3:25 12a1<i>fam</i> omits the <i>s<sup>e</sup>yamē</i>, thus opting for sing.; no variants in Isa 22:22). 
* <span dir="rtl">ܬܪܥܐ</span> (<i>tarʿ</i>), ‘door, gate, entrance’: 1 Chron 9:27.


<b>c. Targum (Tg):</b>  

* <span dir="rtl">מפתחא</span>, ‘key’: Judg 3:25; Isa 22:22 (see A.2).
* <span dir="rtl">אקלידיא</span> (plur., <span dir="rtl">אַקְלִידָא</span> < κλείς), ‘the keys’: 1 Chron 9:27.    


<b>d.  Vulgate (Vg):</b>  

* <i>clavem</i>, ‘key’: Judg 3:25; Isa 22:22.
* <i>aperirent</i> ‘they opened’: 1 Chron 9:27 (interpretatively).


<b>A.1</b>
In most of the manuscripts of the LXX, the translation of <span dir="rtl">וְנָתַתִּי מַפְתֵּחַ בֵּית־דָּוִד עַל־שִׁכְמוֹ</span> in Isa 22:22 is
καὶ δώσω τὴν δόξαν Δαυιδ αὐτῷ, ‘and I will give him the glory of David’. This figurative interpretation is attested in LXX<sup><small>B</small></sup>. In LXX<sup><small>B</small></sup> the following phrase
<span dir="rtl">וּפָתַח וְאֵין סֹגֵר</span> has been rendered interpretatively too: καὶ ἄρξει, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀντιλέγων, ‘and he shall rule, and there shall be no one to contradict him’ (continued literally with καὶ κλείσει καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀνοίγων). Instead, a more literal Greek rendering of the beginning of the verse is attested in LXX<sup><small>A</small></sup> and other manuscripts: καὶ δώσω τὴν κλεῖδα[ν] οἴκου Δαυιδ, ‘and I will give the key of the house of David’, with καὶ ἀνοίξει καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀποκείων as the translation of the following phrase <span dir="rtl">וּפָתַח וְאֵין סֹגֵר</span>. Combinations of the figurative 
and the literal translations exist also (see the editions of 
Swete, Rahlfs and Ziegler for further details). 
As the more literal translation figures already in 
Rev 3:7, this translation seems to be old.

<b>A.2</b>
Like the LXX, the Tg has an interpretative translation of Isa 22:22. Possibly this reflects the royal priesthood of the Hasmonean era.[^29]

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b> 
Other terms for closing instruments are 
<span dir="rtl">בְּרִיחַ</span>, ‘bar’, Deut 3:5, 1 Sam 23:7; Judg 16:3, Ps 147:13, Neh 3:3, 6, 13-15 (on gates); 1 Kgs 4:13 (bronze), Isa 45:2, Ps 107:16 
(iron), etc. (mostly of wood[^7]); further *<span dir="rtl">מִנְעַל</span>, ‘lock’, Deut 33:25+, and <span dir="rtl">מַנְעוּל</span>, ‘lock, bolt’, Song 5:5 (!), Neh 3:3, 6, 13-15+, both from the 
root <span dir="rtl">נָעַל</span> ‘to lock’.[^8]  
[More discussion will be added later.]


## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Literal Use

<b>A.1</b>
In the dramatic events of Judges 
3:15-30 a key-role is played by the <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span>. Many details of the story and of its scene of 
action remain uncertain, as the Hebrew is not 
always clear. King Eglon of Moab is murdered by 
the left-handed Benjaminite Ehud, in the roof 
chamber (<span dir="rtl">עַלִיָּה</span>; cf. 2 Sam 19:1 [18:33]) of his palace. He had ordered his servants out when Ehud 
hinted at a secret message (<span dir="rtl">דְּבַר&thinsp;־סֵתֶר</span>), and had risen from his seat (<span dir="rtl">כִּסֵּא</span>) as Ehud announced a word of God (<span dir="rtl">דְּבַר&thinsp;־אֱלׂהִים</span>) - thus presenting him with the opportunity to kill him with the sword hidden on 
his right thigh (vv. 19-21). Eglon’s fat (cf. v. 17b) closed over the blade (<span dir="rtl">לַהַב</span>) of Ehud’s sword and Ehud closed the doors of the roof chamber 
upon him as he went out into the 
gallery [?] (vv. 22-23; both times <span dir="rtl">בְּעַד</span> <span dir="rtl">סָגַר</span>) and he bolted &lt;them&gt; (<span dir="rtl">וְנָעַל</span>). He had gone out when the servants came in; as they saw the doors of the 
roof chamber bolted (<span dir="rtl">נְעֻלׂות</span>), they waited reverently, supposing that he was relieving 
himself (v. 24). Finally, when - after an 
embarrassing (<span dir="rtl">עַד&thinsp;־בּׂושׁ</span>, cf. 2 Kgs 2:17; 8:11) period of waiting - he did not open the doors, 
they took the key and opened &lt;them&gt; (<span dir="rtl">וַיִּפְתָּחוּ</span> <span dir="rtl"> הַמַּפְתָּחַ</span><span dir="rtl">אֶת־</span> <span dir="rtl">וַיִּקְחוּ</span>), and found their master laying dead on the floor (v. 25) - but 
Ehud had escaped while they tarried (v. 26). 

<b>A.2</b>
In connection with locking doors, which 
could be opened with a <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span>, both <span dir="rtl">סָגַר</span>  (‘to close, shut’) and <span dir="rtl">נָעַל</span> (‘to lock, bolt’, cf. 2 Sam 13:17-18) are used. The problem is: did Ehud lock the main entrance of the room from within 
and then escaped through a back-door,[^30] or did 
he just go out, closed and bolted the doors, 
thereupon facing the waiting servants who, still 
ignorant of his deed, let him go unimpeded? The 
latter seems the preferable interpretation of 
<span dir="rtl">בְּעַד</span> <span dir="rtl">סָגַר</span>, as it usually seems to imply going on, after closing the doors, in the same direction 
(e.g., when entering, Judg 9:51 and 2 Kgs
4:4-5, after √<span dir="rtl">נוס</span> ‘to fly’,  √<span dir="rtl">בוא</span> or √<span dir="rtl">הלך</span>; here, when leaving, after √<span dir="rtl">יצא</span> [v. 24]). In that case it must have been possible to close and bolt the doors inside 
when going out, so that thet  could only be opened 
from the outside by means of a key.[^31] This 
seems to exclude the interpretation of <span dir="rtl">נָעַל</span>  as ‘to lock a door with straps’ (German ‘zubinden’, cf. <span dir="rtl">נַעַל</span> in the sense of ‘to fix a sandal with straps’), as suggested by <i>KBL</i> and <i>HALAT</i>.[^32] Rather one is inclined 
to think of the closing system with bolt and key 
with corresponding pins and holes as described 
for more modern times by Dalman.[^33]                

<b>A.3</b>
1 Chron 9, ‘the closing chapter of the 
Chronicler’s introductory genealogies’, ‘gives a 
summary of the members of the restored community 
after the exile’.[^34] The text runs more or less 
parallel with Neh 11:3-19. However, when 
arriving at the gatekeepers (<span dir="rtl">הַשֹּׁעֲרִים</span>) in v. 17 (Neh 11:19), the agreement stops rather 
abruptly. Neh 11:20 switches over to the 
inhabitants of the other towns of Judah 
(returning, however, immediately to Ophel and 
Jerusalem in vv. 21ff.), whereas 1 Chron 
9:17ff. dwell on the theme of the <span dir="rtl">שֹׁעֲרִים</span>, far beyond the scope of the foregoing summary. 
According to most scholars, this section ends 
with v. 26a, and is succeeded by a more general 
catalogue of temple dignitaries in vv. 26b-33. 
After v. 26b ‘They were in charge of the 
chambers and the treasures of the house of God’, 
v. 27 continues: ‘they passed the night (<span dir="rtl">יָלִינוּ</span>) round about (<span dir="rtl">סְבִיבׂות</span>, cf. Num 11:24, 1 Sam 26:5) the house of God, <span dir="rtl">לַבֹּקֶר</span> <span dir="rtl">וְלַבֹּקֶר</span> <span dir="rtl">עַל&thinsp;־הַמַּפְתָּחַ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְהֵם</span> <span dir="rtl">מִשְׁמֶרֶת</span> <span dir="rtl">כִּי&thinsp;־עֲלֵיהֶם</span>, ‘as they bore the duty of watching it and were 
responsible for opening it’,[^35] ‘and that every 
morning’.[^36] ‘They’ are the Levites of v. 26a and 
probably the <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span> is the key on the doors at the entrance (<span dir="rtl">פֶּּתַח</span>) of the house of God (cf. 1 Kgs 6:33-34 and LXX [see <a href="#AV">4. Ancient Versions</a>]). But it is also possible to return once again to the theme 
of the gatekeepers: they were ‘lodging in the 
vicinity of the house of God’[^37] and the 
key, which they had to administer, was the key of 
the gates (<span dir="rtl">שְׁעָרִים</span>, v. 23 [and 26 LXX]). 

<b>A.4</b>
In Egypt, the vizier ‘let open the gates of the house of the king so that all who wanted to 
enter could enter and all who wanted to go out 
could go out’.[^38]

<b>A.5</b>
Now there is no mention of gates in the 
description of the temple of Solomon and its 
inner and outer courts (1 Kgs 6:36, 7:12), but 
so much the more in Ezekiel’s vision of a new 
temple (Ezek 40 [48x], etc.[^39]). Moreover, the 
closing of gates is mentioned. The outer gate on 
the east side of the sanctuary is shut and shall 
remain shut (<span dir="rtl">סָגוּר</span> , Ezek 44:1-2), whereas the eastern gate of the inner court shall be closed 
on working days, but open on the sabbath (Ezek 46:1, 2, 12). Therefore the question of H.J. Kraus, 
when discussing the <span dir="rtl">שְׁעָרִים</span> of Psalm 24:7-10: ‘des heiligen Bezirkes oder des Tempels?’,[^40] also holds good for 1 Chron 9:27. 

<b>A.6</b>
In fact, <span dir="rtl">עַל&thinsp;־הַמַּפְתָּחַ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְהֵם</span>  in 1 Chron 9:27 could also have been classified with the 
next section (<a href="#Fig">6.2 Figurative Use</a>), as not so much 
the key itself is meant as the daily opening of 
the doors/gates as first thing in the morning 
after passing the night in the precincts of the 
temple, as is explained <i>expressis verbis</i> in the 
LXX (see <a href="#AV">4. Ancient Versions</a>). Several modern translations 
have rendered in that sense, as a kind of verbal 
form of √<span dir="rtl">פתח</span>: ‘opening’, etc.


### <span id="Fig">6.2 Figurative Use</span>

<b>A.1</b> 
 The same question, but then the other way round, 
could be asked in connection with Isa 22:22 
‘And I will place on his shoulder the key of the 
house of David’ (<span dir="rtl">עַל&thinsp;־שִׁכְמׂו</span> <span dir="rtl">בֵּית&thinsp;־דָּוִד</span> <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְנָתַתִּי</span>). Are we dealing here with only a symbolic mentioning of the key (‘I will lay on 
his shoulders the duty of the Davidic palace’[^41]), or is a real key intended? According to 
many commentators the key in question must have 
been a wooden instrument of considerable size and 
weight, so that it had to be carried on the 
shoulder[^42] (‘Die 
Schlüssel der damaligen Zeit waren durchaus so 
groß, daß sie auf die Schulter gelegt werden 
konnten’[^43]). In the case of Judges 3 there is no 
suggestion of such an impressive utensil. But 1 Chron 9:27 seems to underline the importance of 
opening the doors or the gates as an official 
function. 

<b>A.2</b>
Here, in Isa 22:22, it is the token of 
dignity bestowed on Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, as 
he was destined to replace Shebna, who had fallen 
in disgrace, as <span dir="rtl">סֹכֵן</span>  (steward, governor; both men also mentioned Isa 36:3, 11, 22; 37:2 par.). De 
Vaux quotes in this connection the instructions 
of an Egyptian vizier who has to take care of 
opening the gates of the palace, ‘so that could 
enter who had to enter and could leave who had to 
leave’ (see above). In the case of Eliakim the 
same idea has been formulated negatively, more 
emphasizing the social authority of his 
function (cf. v. 21) than its practicability: ‘when he opens, 
none shall shut, and when he shuts, none shall 
open’ (<span dir="rtl">פֹּּתֵחַ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְאֵין</span> <span dir="rtl">וְסָגַר</span> <span dir="rtl">סֹגֵר</span> <span dir="rtl">וְאֵין</span> <span dir="rtl">וּפָתַח</span>, v. 22b). These words were quoted literally in Rev 3:7 and also had their impact on 
Matt 16:19 (cf. 18:18, 23:13; John 20:23), the 
delegation of the keys of the kingdom of heaven 
by Jesus to Simon Peter. 

<b>A.3</b>
Following v. 22, Isa 22:23 is spoken in purely 
figurative language; ‘I will fasten him 
(like) a peg (or: tent-pin, → <span dir="rtl">יָתֵד</span>)  in a sure place (‘in a firm wall’[^44]) and he will 
become a throne of honour  to his 
father’s house’. On the other hand, v. 21 speaks 
realistically of Shebna’s robe and girdle 
(<span dir="rtl">וְאַבְנֵטְךָ</span> <span dir="rtl">כֻּתָּנְתֶּךָ</span>, ‘your vestment  ... your sash’[^45]), with which Eliakim will be clothed as a token of his new authority. Thus for 
the interpretation of <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span>  just in between these verses, both possibilities seem to remain 
open. In the same way ‘house of David’ could mean 
just plainly ‘the palace’[^46] (‘königlichen Wohnsitz’[^47]), ‘the temple’, or 
even ‘the household of David’, but, already when 
spoken by the prophet, it could also have 
referred to the normative and formative past[^48] 
and for that reason the whole expression <span dir="rtl">בֵּית&thinsp;־דָּוִד</span> <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span> could have had  an eschatological and messianic undertone from the beginning. Already 
in LXX both the figurative and the literal 
interpretation have got their expression (see <a href="#AV">4. Ancient Versions</a>).   


### 6.3 Pictorial Material

<b>A.1</b> 
Because there existed several different types of lock and key, some with big keys, others with small keys, it is impossible to offer illustrations covering all of them. Moreover, since reliable archaeological specimens from Israel are lacking, most reconstructions rest on some ancient Egyptian and modern Arabic parallels.[^49]

### 6.4 Archeology

<b>A.1</b> 
As far as I know, no keys from biblical times have been preserved in Israel which is no surprise since normally keys were made of wood. The little that can be said from an archaeological point of view is found in Galling & Rösel.[^50]


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
In the Old Testament there is no lack of 
reference to opening (√<span dir="rtl">פתח</span>) or closing (√<span dir="rtl">סגר</span>) of doors, gates, a window (Gen 8:7), the 
sluices (Gen 7:11), or doors (Ps 78:23) of 
heaven (and of eyes, ears, etc.); in Isa 45:1 it 
is said of Kores that the Lord will open doors 
before him and gates will not be closed. Only 
twice, however, a key is mentioned in this 
connection: moreover, one of these places, 1 Chron 9:27, is rather dubious, as <span dir="rtl">מַפְתֵּחַ</span> could also be explained as a kind of verbal form of 
<span dir="rtl">פתח</span>. Besides, it is not clear whether the key of the house of God (vv. 26, 27a) or that of the 
gates of the temple court is meant. Thus there 
remains only Judg 3:25 as a clear case of a key 
used as an instrument: in order to open the doors 
of the ‘upper chamber’ that Ehud had closed on his escape 
from the murder of king Eglon of Moab. The fact 
that the doors could be opened from whithin and 
again closed and locked (from the outside?, v. 
23), without making use of the key, whereas the 
servants could enter only with the aid of the 
key, forms a crucial point of the story. It also 
tells us something about the construction and 
the form of the lock in question, and perhaps 
also of the locks of those days in general.  

<b>A.2</b>
Despite the general consensus with regard to the meaning ‘key’, the exact shape of keys remains elusive. If future archaeological evidence does not point into another direction, Dalman’s 
description and illustration of the locks in the 
Orient in his days still seems to give the most 
acceptable impression.  Some archaeological evidence from Egypt supports the idea that not much can have been changed with regard to the construction of keys and locks. 

<b>A.3</b>
Most exegetes add to this picture of the key 
in Old Testament times, that ‘the key of the 
House of David’ placed on the shoulder of Eliakim 
must have been of considerable weight and size. However, since several types of locks and keys seem to have existed, it is by no means certain that all keys were that big and heavy.

<b>A.4</b>
The key of Isa 22:22, whether 
taken literally or purely symbolically, in this 
context clearly has the connotation of authority, 
as a token of the high position of the 
<i>maior domus</i>. Some ancient versions betray that the translators were aware of this extra dimension (Tg and the double rendering of LXX).

<b>A.5</b>
Whereas the key of heaven as a symbol of 
authority figures only sporadically in later 
Jewish thought (<a href="#rab">1. Root and Comparitive Material, Rabbinical Literature</a>), it has taken on considerable importance in 
the NT and in later Christianity.

<b>A.6</b>
Personal Note: While preparing this essay, I attended the investiture of the new vicar of the church of our 
village. He was given a big key, with the words: 
you can use this key in two ways, to close (the 
past) and to open (the future). This rather 
unexpected coincidence made me aware of what a 
powerful symbol the key always has been, and 
still can be for the way we are dealing with our
religion: either for closing ourselves from the 
rest of the world, thus becoming a source of 
distrust and hate, death and destruction, or for 
opening ourselves to the world, employing our 
creative abilities for responsibility and love, 
justice and peace.
