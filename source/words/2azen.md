## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  <i>Root.</i>
A connection with √ <i>ʾdn</i> which is always connected with hearing (>
Hebrew <span dir="rtl">אֹזֶן</span>, <span dir="rtl">אזן</span> hiph.) is unlikely. Probably the <span dir="rtl">א</span> is a prosthetic alef (see below), so
the best solution is to assume that the noun has to be vocalized as <span dir="rtl">אְַזֵן</span> rather than as
(unattested) <span dir="rtl">אָזֵן</span>, as it is traditionally vocalized in Hebrew lexica, with the <span dir="rtl">א</span> forming
an open semi-syllable.[^1] This opinion is already
attested with early Hebrew lexicographers.[^2]

<b>A.2</b>
<i>Palmyrean Aramaic.</i>
Hoftijzer and Jongeling noted a word ʾzn of
unknown meaning,[^3] in an inscription in archaic Palmyrean script (end ﬁrst century
bce),[^4] which has the attribute <i>špyr</i>, ‘beautiful’. It appears to be related to the
erection of a statue of two persons to which the expression <i>ʾzn spyr</i> ﬁts. It might
suit a piece of armour like a baldric (cf. <a href="#pic"> 6.3. Pictorial Material</a>), which was often
beautifully decorated (but this may be too speculative).

<b>A.3</b>
<i>Official Aramaic.</i>
<i>zyn<sub>2</sub> / zn<sub>4</sub></i>, ‘weapon, armour’ in Elephantine papyrus Cowley
31:8: <i>znyhwm</i>, in the second draft of the letter to governor Bagohi of Yehud. In the
ﬁrst version Cowley 30:8 the ﬁrst scribe had written <i>tlyhm</i>.[^5] <i>tlyhm</i> from the Semitic
√<i>tly</i> suggests a hanging weapon or piece of armour (in Gen 27:3 most probably a
quiver as part of Esau’s <span dir="rtl">כֵּלִים</span> [<a href=https://sahd-online.com/words/kli/ target="_blank">→ <span dir="rtl">כְּלִי</a></span>] ‘(hunting) equipment’).

<b>A.4</b>
<i>Persian.</i> 
Probably <span dir="rtl">אָזֵן</span> (<span dir="rtl">אֲזֵן</span>) was derived from Awestian <i>zaēna</i>, Old Persian <i>*zaina</i>,
Pehlevi <i>zēn</i>,‘weaponry’.[^6]

<b>A.5</b>
<i>Postbiblical Hebrew.</i> 
<span dir="rtl">זֵן</span>: ‘Waﬀe, eig. wohl Schmuck,
s.w.u. Kriegsrüstung’, with reference to Arab. <i>zayn</i> ‘ornamentum’.[^7]

<b>A.6</b>
<i>Jewish Aramaic.</i>
<span dir="rtl">זֵיְינָה</span>: ‘weapon’.[^8] In TJ to Jer
5:16 and Isa 49:2 <span dir="rtl">אֲזֵינָא</span> is a rendering of Hebrew <span dir="rtl">אַשְׁפָּה</span> ‘quiver’, whereas in Isa 22:6
the same word is equated with Aramaic <span dir="rtl">זֵינָה</span> ‘weapon, weaponry’.[^9]

<a id="RCM7"></a><b>A.7</b>
<i>Samaritan Aramaic.</i>
<span dir="rtl">זיון</span>, <span dir="rtl">זין</span>, <span dir="rtl">זינה</span>: ‘gear’.[^10]

<b>A.8</b>
<i>Syriac.</i>
<i>zaynā</i>: ‘arms, armour, weapons’;[^11]
‘arma’;[^12] <i>zaynā</i> ‘armure, armour’;[^13] <i>zaynā</i> ‘shield, armor, implements’.[^14]

<b>A.9</b>
<i>Classical Arabic.</i>
<i>zayn</i>: ‘ornament, ﬁnery’.[^15]

<b>A.10</b>
<i>Hurrian.</i>
If a word of non-Semitic origin and, perhaps, a loan of Indo-European
provenance, also Hur. <i>ziyani</i> should be taken in consideration. It is attested as a
determined noun or ablative: <i>ziyan(i)=ni/e</i> in the ﬁrst tablet of the Hurrian-Hittite
bilingue <i>para tarnumar</i> ‘Epic of Release’.[^16] It is also attested in the Ugaritic trilingual vocabulary Sa 46.1 HAL
= <i>hallu</i> = <i>ziyani</i> = <i>kurza’u</i> ‘thigh, shank(-bone)’. Also a related or variant noun
may be <i>ziyari</i> ‘side (of body, house)’.[^17] It is known that in
Hurrian many words relating to horse-breeding and warfare have been adopted from
ancient Indo-European stock. If so, it implies that the word <i>(ʾa)zaynu*</i> may have
entered the West-Semitic world at a much earlier stage than the Persian period.

<b>A.11</b>
<i>Rabbinical literature.</i>
Deut 23:14 is quoted in b. Yoma 75b where it is explained that the tool was only
needed to cover up excrements produced by food that was bought from foreign merchants because the manna the Israelites ate normally was digested entirely. In b. Ket.
5a it is proposed to read <span dir="rtl">בְּאָזְנֶךָ</span> ‘in your ear’ which is then interpreted ﬁguratively.

## <a id="AV"></a>4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions (αʹ, σʹ, θʹ):</b>

* LXX Deut 23:14 (13) renders ἐπὶ τῆς ζώνης σου ‘on
your belt’.[^18] LXX’s rendering
suggests that the Hebrew text has been read (or interpreted) as <span dir="rtl">עַל־אֲזֹרֶךָ</span> (<span dir="rtl">אֲזֹר</span>‘girdle’).
However, this interpretation might be a mere guess, since it is unlikely that a soiled
tentpin would have been worn on the belt.

<b>b. Samaritan Targum	 (Tg<small><sup>Smr</sup></small>):</b>

* See: <a href="#RCM7"> Root and Comparative Material, A.7</a>.


<b>c. Peshitta (Pesh):</b>  

* As often, S seems to follow the Targumic tradition in translating <span dir="rtl">עַל־אֲזֵנֶךָ</span> as ‘<i>l zynk</i>, ‘on your equipment’.[^19] It is interesting that the important manuscript family of 9a1 has the variant reading ‘<i>m</i> ‘with (your equipment)’.


<b>d. Targum (Tg):</b> 

* Some manuscripts of TO read <span dir="rtl">אזנך</span>, but the best text has <span dir="rtl">ךניז</span>.[^20] TN Deut. 23:14 has <span dir="rtl">מאזני זייניכון</span>. This would seem a conﬂated
reading which attempts to reconcile the Aramaic with MT. Probably TPs-J has
the better reading here: <span dir="rtl">מאני זיניכון</span>‘your war equipment’.[^21] The Targumists further explain their intention by <span dir="rtl">אתר דתיסדון סייפוּכון</span>‘the
place where you fasten your swords’.[^22] So the Targumim are connecting <span dir="rtl">אָזֵן</span> with Aramaic <span dir="rtl">זֵיְינָה</span>, apparently
regarding the <span dir="rtl">א</span> as prosthetic.


<b>e. Vulgate (Vg):</b>  
* Deut 23:13 <i>balteum</i>, ‘girdle, belt’, apparently following LXX.



## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Literal Use


<b>A.1</b>
The noun <span dir="rtl">אָזֵן</span> occurs in Deut 23:14[^23] only, where it is found within a passage about
purity and cleanliness of the military camp (Deut 23:10-15). In this pericope two
instructions are given. The ﬁrst one (vv. 11-12) is rather vague: ‘When someone
among you is unclean by reason of an accident of the night…’ (<span dir="rtl">מִקְּרֵה־לָיְלָה</span>). Though
modern Bible translations (e.g. NEB; REB) have interpreted this expression as ‘an
emission of seed’, it is not the most probable solution, since ‘emission of seed’ is
elsewhere characterized as <span dir="rtl">שִׁכְבַת־זָרַע</span>(Lev. 15:16).
Therefore, <span dir="rtl">מִקְּרֵה־לָיְלָה</span> in Deut
23:11 should be considered a more general term: every kind of accident related to
impurity that could happen at night. The second case discussed in Deut 23:10-15
concerns a speciﬁc instruction on easing oneself (vv. 13-15). This has to be done (1)
at a special place (<span dir="rtl">יָד</span>[v. 13][^24]) outside the camp and
(2) with a speciﬁc tool. One has to scrape ( <span dir="rtl">חפר</span> qal) a hole with a tentpeg or pin
(→ <span dir="rtl">יָתֵד</span>) in order to cover the excrements.

<b>A.2</b>
The instruction in Deut 23:14 is rather peculiar, as ‘there is no Biblical reference to the eﬀect that human excrement deﬁles’.[^25] It is therefore
motivated in Deut 23:15 as having a theological, rather than a practical background:
God’s presence in the camp requires purity. J. Tigay writes, ‘it may be objectionable
in God’s presence simply because it is ﬁlthy and repugnant. However, Ezekiel’s
objection, as a priest, to eating food cooked over human excrement as fuel may
indicate that it was regarded as impure in some contexts (Ezek 4:12-15)’.[^26] The proximity of the preceding verses, especially v. 11, argues in favour
of this interpretation.

<b>A.3</b>
It is the apposition <span dir="rtl">עַל־אֲזֵנֶךָ</span> in Deut 23:14 that poses a problem, mainly because
the noun <span dir="rtl">אָזֵן</span> is a hapax legomenon in the Hebrew Bible, though it is not listed as
such in either Cohen, BHL, or Greenspahn, HLBH. The preposition <span dir="rtl">עַל</span> can have
many meanings,[^27] but in view of the
fact that the <span dir="rtl">יָתֵד</span> came into contact with excrements it is unlikely that the meaning
would be ‘among, with’ or ‘on, over’ here. The preposition could mean ‘in addition
to, besides’,[^28] implying that it should be kept apart from <span dir="rtl">אֲזֵֶנֶךָ</span>,
probably a generic term for ‘(military) equipment, weapons’.


### 6.2 Figurative Use

<b>A.1</b> 
Not attested.




### 6.3 Pictorial Material<a id="pic"></a>

<b>A.1</b> 
If <span dir="rtl">אֲזֵן</span> was a general term for weaponry and armour, it is diﬃcult if not futile to
search for relevant examples in the vast iconographic resources of the art of warfare
in the ancient Near East. If, however, it may be assumed that as a hapax legomenon
the word designated a rare piece of equipment, or was a rare term for a speciﬁc piece
of armour such as a kind of baldric hanging from the girdle or a shoulder-belt, it is
rather easy to provide examples of them from ancient Near Eastern iconography. We
display one example of each. First, the often beautifully decorated Persian ‘akinakes’
or short sword from the southern ‘Treasury Relief’ at Persepolis (Figure 1). The decorated leather scabbard is here hanging from the girdle connected to
it by a single metal device.[^29]

Baldricks or shoulderbelts made from leather straps hanging over the right shoul-
der slanting to the left, are known since the Late Bronze Age. They also appear
frequently in the Neo-Assyrian-Babylonian and Persian period. Compare, for in-
stance the two reliefs which show king Ashurbanipal (668-ca 627 v.Chr.) and king
Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 v.Chr.) hunting lions (Figure 2; Figure 3).[^31]

### 6.4 Archeology

<b>A.1</b> 
A large number of diﬀerent types of Assyrian and Persian swords, usually made from
bronze alloys, have been found in excavations all over the ancient Near East includ-
ing Palestine and are nowadays on display in museum collections.[^32] Also often the
remains of the golden and silver adornments of the ornamented hilts and scabbards
have been unearthed.[^33]
These material remains complete nicely the iconographic
records cited above. Unfortunately, the leather parts of the scabbards and straps
of the belts and baldrics perished except for an occasionally preserved bronze ring,
buckle or some small ﬂoral ornaments adorning these parts of the weaponry. As
early as about 1500 BCE in shaft-grave V at Mycenae (Greece) the golden adorn-
ments of a bronze swords scabbards and baldrics were found, which are examples
of how a beautiful and a precious baldric could look like in the ancient Near East
(Figure 4). Near a long bronze sword, a golden shoulder-belt was found.
The strip gold was about 130 cm (4 ft.) long and about 3 cm (1 3/4 in.) broad.
In the extremity of the shoulder-belt are two perforations; at the other end there
has probably been a clasp, because no perforations are present. Near this shoulder-
belt a gold decorated disk similar to the ones covering the sword’s scabbard was
also found. Many of such round golden and silver ﬂoral plates have been found all
over the ancient world. These golden belts were the covering decorative element of
leather baldrics used for the sword’s scabbard suspension.[^34]

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
The word is a hapax legomenon, perhaps borrowed from an Indo-European language.
If a relationship be accepted with Hurrian <i>ziyani</i> and <i>ziyari</i>, it may have entered the West-Semitic languages in the Bronze Age. According to the Septuagint and
the Vulgate the apposition <span dir="rtl">עַל־אֲזֵנֶךָ</span> in Deut 23:14 refers to a speciﬁc spot (‘on your
girdle’) or a special piece of equipment to attach the scabbard for sword or dagger
to a girdle or a shoulder-belt (baldrick, the Roman balteus).
The same kind of
equipment is also supposed to carry the special → <span dir="rtl">יָתֵד</span>‘tentpin’ used when leaving
the camp towards the special place to ease oneself.

<b>A.2</b>
Some considerations argue in favour of a more general, collective meaning of
the word. This more general meaning ‘equipment, weaponry’ has been preserved
in Oﬃcial Aramaic, Persian, Postbiblical Hebrew, Targumic Aramaic, and Syriac.
Though the context does not provide conclusive evidence to decide which of these two
options is correct, a specialized meaning such as a ‘baldrick’ seems to be preferable
because of the fact that it is a hapax legomenon in the Old Testament Hebrew, i.e.
a rarely used term. Another possible solution is to translate ‘in addition to your
equipment’ which would imply that it should be kept apart from the other gear
because of its hygienic use. Though not deﬁling in the strict religious sense, and
obviously cleaned when used and carried around for sanitary purpose attached to a
belt like the other weaponry, it was still regarded repugnant in the presence of God.
