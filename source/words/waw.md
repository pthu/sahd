## 6. Exegesis 

<b>A.1</b> 
The noun
<span dir="rtl">וָו</span>
occurs only in the book of Exodus 
in the context of the construction of 
the Tabernacle (<span dir="rtl">מִשְׁכָּן</span>). The first five 
instances (Exod 26:32, 37; 27:10, 11, 17) are 
about receiving the order to construct the 
sanctuary; the other eight passages (36:36, 38; 
38:10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 28) are about carrying out 
the order.

<b>A.2</b> 
English dictionaries usually translate <span dir="rtl">וָו</span> as either ‘nail’, or ‘hook’, or they mention both of these translations.[^7] The corresponding common German renderings are ‘Nagel’ or ‘Haken’.[^8] A proper analysis of the textual evidence may show which translation is best. It has been suggested that the name of the letter 
<i>waw</i> was derived from the shape of the <span dir="rtl">וָו</span> (Driver 1954:162).

<!--*LHA*, 201: ‘uncus, clavus aduncus (Haken, crochet, hook)’ --
*TPC*, 399: ‘clavus, uncinus, paxillus’.
*DBHE*, 192: ‘escarpia, clavo’ --

<b>A.3</b> 
In Exod 26:32 Moses is assigned to make 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>
of gold at the four pillars of acacia (<span dir="rtl">עַמּוּדֵי שִׁטִּים</span>), 
which are overlaid with gold and rest 
on four bases of silver (<span dir="rtl">אַדְנֵי־כָסֶף</span>). According to Exod 26:33, the pillars 
served for hanging up the tapestry 
(<span dir="rtl">פָּרֹכֶת</span>)
that separated (<span dir="rtl">בדל</span> <i>hiph.</i>) the holy place 
(<span dir="rtl">קֹדֶשׁ</span>)
from the most holy 
(<span dir="rtl">קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים</span>). 
It is not clear how exactly the tapestry has to be 
hung on the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>. Exodus 26:33 describes
that the tapestry shall be hung under the 
<span dir="rtl">קְרָסִים</span>.
In Exod 26:37 Moses again has to make
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>
of gold at five pillars of acacia
(<span dir="rtl">עַמּוּדֵי שִׁטִּים</span>), 
which are overlaid with gold and have five bases of bronze
(<span dir="rtl">אַדְנֵי נְחֹשֶׁת</span>). According to Exod 26:36, these pillars serve for another kind of curtain, namely the screen (<span dir="rtl">מָסָךְ</span>) 
for the entrance (<span dir="rtl">פֶּתַח</span>) of the tent (<span dir="rtl">אֹהֶל</span>).
In Exod 27:10 Moses has to make <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>
and their
<span dir="rtl">חֲשִֻׁקִים</span>
of silver for the 
twenty pillars (<span dir="rtl">עַמֻּדִ֛ים</span>), which have twenty bases 
(<span dir="rtl">אֲדָנִים</span>) of bronze. These pillars serve for 
hanging up the great hangings 
(<span dir="rtl">קְלָעִים</span>) that 
fence the four sides of the court 
(<span dir="rtl">חָצֵר</span>) 
of the Tabernacle (27:9).  

<b>A.4</b> 
The meaning of the word <span dir="rtl">חֲשִֻׁקִים</span> in 
this description is also uncertain. But two passages use the 
participle <i>pu‘al</i> of √<span dir="rtl">חשׁק</span> to indicate 
that the pillars were connected by these objects made of silver (Exod 
27:17; 38:17). Because they are also connected to the 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>, it is likely that the
<span dir="rtl">חֲשִֻׁקִים</span> were cross-beams, which were fixed to the 
upper ends of the pillars by means of the 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>. In fact, Exod 38:28 specifies that Moses overlaid the 
capitals of the pillars and ‘connected them’ (<span dir="rtl">וְחִשַּׁ֥ק אֹתָֽם</span>), apparently making use of the 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> that are mentioned just before. This construction lent 
stability to the upper part of the Tabernacle and guaranteed that the 
pillars would always stand at the proper distance from each other to 
accommodate the curtains.

<b>A.5</b> 
Exod 27:11 repeats the data for the north side 
of the court: ‘Make <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> and their 
cross-beams (<span dir="rtl">חֲשֻׁקֵיהֶם</span>) of silver at the twenty 
pillars (<span dir="rtl">עַמֻּדִ֛ים</span>), which have twenty bases 
(<span dir="rtl">אֲדָנִים</span>) of bronze’. In the verses 12-16 the 
curtain, the pillars and their bases are 
mentioned again for the other sides of the court, 
but here the  <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> and the cross-beams are not 
mentioned.
However, Exod 27:17 summarizes the pillars for all the 
sides of the court, interconnected (<span dir="rtl">מְחֻשָּׁקִים</span>) with 
silver and with their 
<span dir="rtl">וָוֵיהֶם</span>
of silver 
and their bases of bronze.

<b>A.6</b> 
Exod 36:36 mentions the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>  in the context of 
the actual making of the Tabernacle. Moses made 
four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with 
gold, their <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> of gold for the 
tapestry (<span dir="rtl">פָּרֹכֶת</span>) that has to separate the holy 
place from the most holy.

<b>A.7</b> 
In Exod 36:38 the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> are mentioned in the 
context of the making of the screen (<span dir="rtl">מָסָךְ</span>) for 
the entrance of the tent: five pillars of acacia, with their 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>. The 
material they are made of is unclear. It is only said that the pillars, 
their capitals (<span dir="rtl">רָאשֵׁיהֶם</span>) and their cross-beams 
(<span dir="rtl">חֲשֻׁקֵיהֶם</span>) were overlaid with gold 
and that the five bases were of bronze.

<b>A.8</b> 
Exod 38:9-16 describes the actual making of the 
hangings of the court 
(<span dir="rtl">קַלְעֵי הֶֽחָצֵר</span>). For the 
south side, twenty pillars and their twenty bases 
were of bronze, the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> of the pillars 
(<span dir="rtl">וָוֵי הָעַמֻּדִים</span>) and their cross-beams (<span dir="rtl">חֲשֻׁקֵיהֶם</span>) 
were silver (38:9-10). 
Exod 38:11 has exactly the same formulation for 
the north side.
Exod 38:12 has almost the same formulation for 
the west side; the only difference is that there 
are ten pillars and ten bases. Exod 38:13, referring 
to the east side of the court, does not mention 
the hooks or the pillars; only the length of the 
hangings is given.

<b>A.9</b> 
Exod 38:17 recapitulates the data about the 
material for the pillars and their components: 
the bases for the pillars were of bronze, the 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> for the pillars and their cross-beams were of 
silver, likewise the overlaying of their capitals.
Exod 38:18-19 deals with the screen for the 
gate of the court (<span dir="rtl">מָסַךְ שַׁעַר הֶחָצֵר</span>): their four pillars and four 
bases were of bronze, their <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> of silver, 
likewise their overlaying and their cross-beams.
In Exod 38:28 the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> are mentioned in the 
context of the costs for the Tabernacle. The 
silver that was brought in by the congregation 
was 100 talents (<span dir="rtl">כִּכָּר</span>) and 1775 shekels 
(<span dir="rtl">שֶׁקֶל</span>) (38:25). 
The <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> for the pillars 
(<span dir="rtl">וָוִים לָעַמּוּדִים</span>; 38:28) were made of the 1775 
shekels, like the overlaying of their capitals 
and cross-beams.

<b>A.10</b> 
In all the passages the noun <span dir="rtl">וָו</span> occurs in the plural. Apparently it was uncommon to use only one <span dir="rtl">וָו</span>. In all the contexts the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> are 
attached to the pillars of the Tabernacle. In six verses they are called ‘their 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>‘ (<span dir="rtl">וָוֵיהֶם</span>, 26:32, 
37; 27:17; 36:36, 38; 38:19); in six verses they are called ‘the 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> of the pillars’ (27:10, 11; 38:10, 11, 
12, 17), and in one verse ‘the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> for the 
pillars’ (38:28). They seem to serve as a point of suspension for the 
various curtains in the Tabernacle.

<b>A.11</b> 
However, it is not explicitly said that the curtains were hung on the 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>. The only place where it is said the 
tapestry has to be put (<span dir="rtl">נתן</span>) 
on the pillars uses 
the expression 
<span dir="rtl">תַּחַת הַקְּרָסים</span>,
‘under the 
<span dir="rtl">קְרָסִים</span>’ (26:33). Consequently, the 
<span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> seem to have a closer connection with 
the pillars than with the curtains, and the 
<span dir="rtl">קְרָסִים</span>
seem to connect them with the curtains. So the 
<span dir="rtl">קְרָסִים</span>
are most likely ‘curtain-rings’ or ‘clasps’. 


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> 
In view of the quasi-absence of cognates and reliable extra-biblical 
evidence, identifying the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span> is difficult.  The rendering ‘nail’ is 
unlikely, because a
<span dir="rtl">מַסְמֵר</span>
seems to be a carpenter’s nail and because a considerable weight was 
suspended from the <span dir="rtl">וָוִים</span>. Also ‘ring’ 
(cf. LXX κρίκος) 
is unlikely because it would have been left unspecified how 
these rings were connected to the pillars. Other ancient versions 
render by ‘head’ or ‘capital’, which also looks like guesswork and is in 
conflict with Exod 36:38; 38:17, 19, 28, where also
<span dir="rtl">רֵאשׁ</span>
occurs (Houtman 2000:437). 

<b>A.2</b> 
Pegs with a bulging head are a possibility (cf. Tg<small><sup>Smr</sup></small>), but the rings might have slipped off easily, especially if the Tabernacle had to resist strong winds. 

<b>A.3</b> Therefore, the rendering 
‘hook’ is the most likely one. The function of these hooks was to 
provide support for the curtains and to fix the cross-beams between 
the pillars. Their weight in gold and silver was considerable, even 
if the precious metals were used as a plating of wood only. Therefore, it must have been a sturdy type of hook over which the rings 
or clasps of the curtains were thrown when the framework of the 
Tabernacle had been erected.
