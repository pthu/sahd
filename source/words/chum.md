##1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>
KBL<sup>3</sup> identifies the root as either
<span dir="rtl">חום</span>
or
<span dir="rtl">חמם</span>.[^1]
Gradwohl prefers <span dir="rtl">חמם</span>,
‘warm sein’; in his judgement it is the colour that results from something being burned (Gradwohl 1963:50; also Beyse 1977:1047). Brenner, however, is not persuaded by Gradwohl’s proposal (Brenner 1982:122).

<b>A.2</b> See <span dir="rtl">חמם</span>.



## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  The form is <i>qūl</i> (BL, 452, §61r) or <i>qull</i> (BL, 455, §61fʹ).



## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b> 
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span>
stands both in an attribute position with 
<span dir="rtl">שֶׂה</span>
(Gen 30:32) and as a predicative adjective (Gen 30:33).
It also occurs as a substantivised adjective for sheep of this colour (Gen 30:35, 40). In the latter usage it is followed by a prepositional phrase identifying this species as belonging to the sheep 
<span dir="rtl">בַּכְּשָׂבִים</span>
(Gen 30:35) or the flock
<span dir="rtl">בְּצֹאן</span>
(Gen 30:40).

<b>d.  Vulgate (Vg):</b>  

* <i>furvus</i>, ‘dark-coloured, dark, black’: Gen 30:32, 33, 40. For Gen 30:35, see A.2.

<b>A.1</b>
LXX, Tg<sup><small>O</small></sup> and Vg gloss
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span>
with a lexeme that represents a dark colour to black. The colour represented by Aram. <span dir="rtl">לחושׁ</span>, the gloss in Tg<sup><small>N</small></sup> and Tg<sup><small>PsJ</small></sup>, has not been determined. Pesh’s gloss <span dir="rtl">ܐܟܡ</span> (<i>ʾāḵem</i>), supported by LXX’s gloss ποικίλος, ‘multi-coloured’, in Gen 30:40, suggests that these translators considered that
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span>
conveyed a pattern more than a hue. In any case it is clear that the translators sought to differentiate 
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> from <span dir="rtl">שָׁחֹר</span> (Brenner 1982:122-23), but they were no longer aware of the precise meaning of this archaic Heb. lexeme, other than it signaled a ‘non-white’ colour.

<b>A.2</b> Jerome (Vg) offers a free rendering of Gen 30:35 and includes the gloss <i>niger</i>, 
‘black’, probably because of the presence of 
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span>
in the MT, but the Vg reading is not a one to one equivalent of the Heb. The free translation of Gen 30:35 impacts the way Jerome glosses Gen 30:40. 


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields


<b>A.1</b> Rashi glosses
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span>
with <span dir="rtl">שָׁחוּם דּוֹמֶה לְאָדֹם</span>,
‘dark, somewhat reddish’, apparently influenced by 
<span dir="rtl">לחושׁ</span> in Tg<sup><small>PsJ</small></sup>.[^14]
Shalem gives ‘dark red’, inclining to ‘black’ (1932:68).
The relationship between <span dir="rtl">חוּם</span>
and <span dir="rtl">שָׁחֹר</span> is difficult to assess since 
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> occurs only for sheep in Gen 30 and 
<span dir="rtl">שָׁחֹר</span> only occurs in Lev 13 in reference to hair, though the <span dir="rtl">שׁחר</span> root is more widely attested. Brenner proposes that because of the ancient versions—especially the LXX, which has the gloss 
φαιός, ‘grey, dark complexioned’, for three of the four occurrences of
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> and 
ποικίλος, ‘multi-coloured, variegated’, for the other one and prefers
μέλας, ‘black’, for 
<span dir="rtl">שָׁחֹר</span>—<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> may be a specification of <span dir="rtl">שָׁחֹר</span> (Brenner 1982:122-23). She classifies it as a submember of the class
<span dir="rtl">שָׁחֹר</span>. She is on the right tract; probably 
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> was a contextualised colour lexeme for a species of sheep with coats ranging in colour from
‘reddish brown’
to ‘dark brown’
and ‘black’.[^15]

[^14]: Rashi, translated by Rosenbaum & Silbermann 1929-34:144.
[^15]: Beyse (1977:1047) gives the glosses ‘bräunlich, schwärzlich, braun-schwarz’.

<b>A.2</b>
<span dir="rtl">חוּם בַּכְּשָׂבִים</span> (Gen 30:33, 35) stands in contrast to
<span dir="rtl">נָקֹד וְטָלוּא בָּעִזִּים</span>, ‘white spotted or streaked among goats’. These contextualised colour lexemes refer to non-dominant members of the respective species in the flock.




## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b>
In one of several contracts for shepherding Laban’s flocks, Jacob was to receive the lambs born dark brown or black <span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> (Gen 30:25-43).
Since Jacob’s plan was to win an agreement from Laban whereby he could use his breeding skills to build his own
flock from the offspring born a non-dominant colour, it may be assumed that 
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> identified a species of sheep having a non-dominant colour.

<b>B.1</b>
The commentator Jacob argues that <span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> is unlikely ‘black’, for black sheep are dominant in the Near East (Jacob 1934:604). He takes the position that ‘es ist wohl das an Schafen häufige, leicht in Schwarz übergehende Rostrot’ (Jacob 1934:604). While it is difficult to assess the correctness of his claim about the colour of most sheep in that ancient era, given the dominant light colour of present-day sheep, the burden of proof lies with his position.



## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span> is attested only in Early Biblical Hebrew, being used to identify certain kind of sheep by their dark colour, either ‘rust’, ‘dark brown’, or ‘black’.[^16]
That is,
<span dir="rtl">חוּם</span>
functions as a contextualised colour lexeme used by ancient shepherds. Thus it is not a salient colour lexeme. It appears to have dropped out of usage in Late Biblical Hebrew.
