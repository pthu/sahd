## 1. Root and Comparative Material


<b>A.1</b> In the Hebrew Bible there is a related adjectival form  <span dir="rtl">צָלִי</span>, and
this also occurs three times in the biblical corpus, with a similar meaning — in this case ‘roasted’ or as a substantive ‘roasted (meat)’. It is found in Exod 12:8, 9; Isa 44:16.

<b>A.2</b> <i>Aramaic</i>: The lexeme also occurs in Palestinian and Babylonian Jewish Aramaic as one of multiple words that use the root <span dir="rtl">צלי</span>, likewise meaning ‘roast’.[^1]

<b>A.3</b> <i>Ethiopic</i> retains a ‘broil’ or ‘roast’ meaning with the form <i>ṣalawa</i> (<i>CDG</i>, 556–557: <i>ṣalawa</i> II).

<b>A.4</b> <i>Arabic</i> uses the root <i>ṣly</i> for ‘broil’, ‘roast’, or ‘fry’ (Lane, 4:1721b: <i>ṣly</i>).

<b>A.5</b> <i>Akkadian</i>: The root is used in Akkadian and appears as <i>ṣelû</i>. However, the word has less to do with roasting for cooking purposes, and more to do
with burning incense or sweet-smelling items (<i>CAD</i> Ṣ, 124: <i>ṣelû</i> A).

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b> The lexeme is a <span dir="rtl">ל״ה</span> (<span dir="rtl">ל״י</span>) verb.

<b>A.2</b> Each occurrence is in the <i>qal</i>, two of which are prefixed forms, with the third being an infinitive construct.

<b>A.3</b> There is, as mentioned above, a corresponding adjectival form  <span dir="rtl">צָלִי</span> that occurs three times in the biblical text.


<span id="Syn"> 
## 3. Syntagmatics</span>

<b>A.1</b> The subjects of this lexeme are human beings. In 1 Samuel 2:15, the subject of the infinitive is the priest, <span dir="rtl">כֹּהֵן</span>. In Isaiah 44:16 and 19, the subject is undoubtedly a human, but greater specificity is elusive. In verse 16, the subject may simply be a generic human, the grammatical subject being indicated only by the 3 masc.sg. verbs present. However, it is probable that the subject may be found as early as v. 13 where the text introduces a wood craftsman,  <span dir="rtl">חָרַשׁ עֵצִים</span>.

<b>A.2</b> The objects of this lexeme include <span dir="rtl">בָּשָׂר</span> (1 Sam 2:15, Isa 44:19) and  <span dir="rtl">צָלִי</span> (Isa 44:16). Presumably the latter is, like the former, expected to be meat. Each of the other occurrences of both the verbal lexeme  <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> and the adjectival form  <span dir="rtl">צָלִי</span> are clearly concerned with meat
and one can therefore assume the same for Isa 44:16.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>:

* ὀπτάω, ‘roast, broil’: 1 Sam 2:15; Isa 44:16, 19.

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܛܘܝ</span> (<i>ṭwy</i>), ‘roast, bake’: 1 Sam 2:15; Isa 44:16, 19.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: J)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">טוי</span>, ‘roast, cook’: 
1 Sam 2:15; Isa 44:16, 19.

<b>d.Vulgate (Vg)</b>: 1 Sam 2:15; Isa 44:16, 19.

* <i>coquo</i>, ‘cook, bake, boil, roast’.


<b>A.1</b> Each of the above words consistently replaces the Hebrew  <span dir="rtl">צלה</span>. However, they each appear in other places, where the Hebrew uses a
different cooking verb. For example, ὀπτάω in the LXX also stands in where the Hebrew has  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span>, both in Deut 16:7 and in 2 Chron
35:13 – two of the Passover texts.[^2]  <span dir="rtl">טוי</span> in Tgs does the same
in 2 Chron 35:13, but retains  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> in Deut 16:7. In Pesh, unlike Tg or LXX, the root <span dir="rtl">ܒܫܠ</span> (<i>bšl</i>) is used both in 2 Chronicles and Deuteronomy.


<b>A.2</b> The case of Vg is slightly different than that of the other versions. Unlike these other versions, the Vulgate uses a generic cooking verb, <i>coquo</i>, where the Hebrew has <span dir="rtl">צלה</span>. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that this Latin verb is used in many other places translating a range of other cooking verbs. 
However, what is intriguing is that <i>coquo</i> is used for <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> in Deut 16:7, but a more specific roasting verb, <i>asso</i>, is used for <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> in 2 Chron 35:13. This change to <i>asso</i> in Chronicles agrees with the Tgs and LXX, though differs from Pesh. It is also odd that Vg avoids using <i>asso</i> to translate the clear roasting verb <span dir="rtl">צלה</span>, but chooses the generic <i>coquo</i> instead – a move that none of the other versions make.

<span id="LSF">
## 5. Lexical/Semantic Field</span>



<b>A.1</b> The lexeme is part of a group of cooking verbs, which consists of the following other lexemes:  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">אפה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">בעה</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">זיד</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">לבב</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">עוג</span>, 
<span dir="rtl">קלה</span>, and
<span dir="rtl">רתח</span> (Peters 2016:90-138). 
Each of these lexemes denotes something different about cooking.
Some are more specific or generic than others. Some are for dry cooking and others for cooking with liquid.

<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> ranks as one of the more specific terms as it denotes roasting with an open fire, as discussed in <a href="#ExA1">Exegesis</a> below. It is, therefore, more specific than the broader terms <span dir="rtl">אפה</span> and  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span>, for example.

<b>A.3</b> In terms of their general meaning, <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> and <span dir="rtl">קלה</span> appear to be closely related, though they are never used in parallel or in the same kinds of contexts. <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> tends to refer to the roasting of meat, while the clearest cases of <span dir="rtl">קלה</span> have to do with roasting grain. However, one cannot be too confident as to the nature of their relationship, given that neither verb occurs very frequently.


<span id="ExA1">
## 6. Exegesis</span>

<b>A.1</b>
 <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> refers to the cooking of meat by means of an open fire. That meat is expected is supported by the fact that the objects of the verb, and the referents of the related adjective, are all meat items. This is also what distinguishes  <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> from  <span dir="rtl">קלה</span>.

<b>A.2</b> That direct heat from an open fire is required is what separates this dry-cooking verb apart from the more common  <span dir="rtl">אפה</span>, which typically designates indirect heat baking. Furthermore,  <span dir="rtl">אפה</span> entails the making of bread-type items, as opposed to meat.

<b>A.3</b> In support of the above statements, <i>HALOT</i>, BDB, and <i>DCH</i> all translate  <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> as ‘roast’, the latter two of which also mention clearly that this process involves flesh or meat.

<b>B.1</b> The Passover texts introduce a problem with the meaning of the present lexeme and its relationship to  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span>. While Exod 12:8-9
requires that the Passover lamb be roasted (<span dir="rtl">צלה</span>) and specifically says that it ought not to be boiled (<span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span>) in water, Deut 16:7 expressly commands that the Passover lamb be boiled (<span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span>). There is of
course a long history of exegetical wrestling as it relates to this passage. If it were true, as some argue, that <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> is a generic cooking verb and can likewise mean ‘boil’ and simply ‘cook’, then there would be no contradiction between the two texts.[^3] Exodus would still assert that the lamb is to be roasted and not ‘cooked in water’ (i.e. boiled),
whereas Deuteronomy would simply assert that the lamb is to be cooked. If all this were true, the one might argue that <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> could stand in for
<span dir="rtl">צלה</span> as a more generic cooking verb. 
However, this assertion, that <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> could be a generic cooking verb, is unlikely to be true. Both in medieval Jewish sources and in part of modern scholarship, the ideological starting point is that these two Passover texts (Exod 12:8-9; Deut 16:7) must not contradict one another. The other occurrences of  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> are, however, clearly related to some kind of liquid cooking. Furthermore, liquid cooking was a primary mode of cooking in ancient Palestine and it would be extremely odd for there to be no extant verb related specifically to boiling (in contrast to there being two different lexemes related to different kinds of roasting). While the argument receives more detailed treatment in the discussion of <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> (Peters 2016:97-106), one can at least here assert that  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> is unlikely to be a generic cooking verb, that Exodus and Deuteronomy therefore prescribe different cooking methods for the Passover lamb, and that  <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> is not a more generic substitute for the more specific  <span dir="rtl">צלה</span> (Peters 2016:176-86).[^4]

## 7. Conclusions

The Hebrew lexeme <span dir="rtl">צלה</span>, though it occurs only rarely, is a verb that poses little difficulty for clarity. It is a root attested in other
Semitic languages, though it is equally rare in most of these – most likely reflecting how authors of these ancient texts did not prioritize cooking vocabulary, especially not the more specific cooking terms. In
Hebrew it entails the roasting of meat over a flame (Peters 2016:126-28), thereby distinguishing this word both from baking (<span dir="rtl">אפה</span>) and from roasting non-meat items (<span dir="rtl">קלה</span>).

[^3]: For a representative set of examples, see Rashi <i>ad</i> Deut 16:7 and 2 Chron 35:13; Shachter 2003:75; Driver 1902:193–94; McConville 1984:117–18; Dillard 1987:285; Shaver 1989:116; Labuschagne 1990:98–99; Tigay 1996:155. 
[^4]: For those who represent this view, see, e.g., Benzinger 1901:132; Galling 1954:179–80; Van den Born 1960:232–33; Myers 1965:211; Williamson 1982:407; Fishbane 1985:135–36; Becker 1988:121; Sarna 1991:245; Japhet 1993:1052–53; Tuell 2001:240; McKenzie 2004:364; Ben Zvi 2006:240–41; Clements 1972:72; Phillips 1973:113. Both Clements and Phillips suggest a contradiction between Exodus and Deuteronomy. Roubos (1972:297) notes that there is a contradiction between Exodus and Deuteronomy, though he also argues that the verb <span dir="rtl">בשׁל</span> is flexible enough to cover both ‘bake’ and ‘boil’.
