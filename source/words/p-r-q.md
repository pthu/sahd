### Text doubtful:
<span id="TDB1"></span>

<b>B.1</b>  Ps 7:3: On the basis of the Versions Graetz (1882-83:169-70) and
others (cf. Briggs and Briggs 1907-09:52-53, 57) inserted  <span dir="rtl">אֵין</span> before  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> of MT (cf. LXX, Pesh) and Gunkel (1926:25) read  <span dir="rtl">יִפְרֹק</span> (cf. Tg, Vg). The
former proposal, which was adopted by Kraus (1978:190-91; cf. <i>BHS</i>,
<i>HAL</i>), is claimed to be required by the meaning of  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> elsewhere (esp.
in Ps 136 and Lam 5). The latter proposal(which Anderson [1972:94] also
mentions favourably) can point to a close parallel in Isa 5:29 (with
 <span dir="rtl">פלט</span>). But LXX may have been trying to make sense of a text like MT which
it did not understand on the basis of the similar passages cited, and
there do seem to be a number of places (see below) where  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> means
something other than ‘save’. The other emendation is more attractive,
but it is by no means certain (even unlikely) that Tg. and Vg were based
on a different <i>Vorlage</i> from MT (compare modern translations which
render similarly without departing from MT [EÜ, NRSV; cf. Seybold]). MT
should probably be retained, with the participle being understood in the
sense ‘rend’, either adjectivally (cf. AV, RSV) or as a nominalised
subject of  <span dir="rtl">יטרף</span> (but the latter involves a less likely stichometry).

Qere/Ketiv: none.

## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b> For cognate nouns, see <a href="/sahd/words/plunder/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>.

<b>A.2</b>  A verb <i>prq</i> is widely attested in Semitic, with meanings that are
distinct (this is true even within particular languages) but close
enough for it to be plausible to suggest a <i>Grundbedeutung</i> from which
all the others are derived (see B.1 below).

<span id="RCMA3"><b>A.3</b></span> In <i>North-West Semitic</i> the earliest occurrences are in Ugaritic, in
a formulaic idiom <i>yprq lṣb</i> (<i>KTU</i> 1.4 iv:28; 1.6 iii:16; 1.17 ii:10), which was formerly understood to refer to the ‘opening’ of ‘the passage of the throat’ (see the earlier refs. in <i>HAL</i>, 916) but which is now known to mean ‘he unknitted (his) brow’, from a broader sense ‘release, slacken’ (<i>DULAT</i><small><sup> 1</sup></small>, 681; for the newer understanding of <i>lṣb</i> see p. 505). In later Hebrew the most common meanings are ‘remove’, ‘separate’ and ‘take to pieces’ (for other meanings see Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1238-39). In Aramaic there is one early occurrence in a fragmentary portion of the Sefire treaties (<i>KAI</i> 222B 34), for which <i>DNWSI</i>, 943, proposed ‘cut off (water-supply?)’, but the context is damaged and unclear (<i>HAL</i>, 916, has ‘zerstören’, Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small>, 1083, ‘auflösen, befreien’) and no secure conclusions can be drawn. In early Jewish rendering for Heb. <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> (4Q157=TgJob f1 ii 9, prob. Job 5:7), <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (11Q10=TgJob 23:6, Job 33:28) and  <span dir="rtl">חלץ</span> (ibid. 27:9; Job 36:15), implying the meaning ‘save, redeem’. The contexts in 4Q541 f24 ii:3 and 4Q546 f8 1 are badly damaged and
unclear (but see DJD XXXI, 252-54, 360, which suggests ‘redeemed’ [i.e. ‘forgave (faults)’] for the former passage). In Nabataean the sense ‘redeem’ is attested,[^rcm1] while in Jewish magical texts it means ‘loosen’ (a demon: better ‘remove’?)
according to <i>DNWSI</i>, 943. In other Jewish Aramaic texts, especially the Targums, the meanings ‘redeem’ and ‘rescue’ are most common, but ‘remove’, ‘fall apart’, ‘untie’ and ‘divide’ are also attested.[^rcm2] 
Samaritan Aramaic knows the meanings ‘redeem’, ‘go away’, ‘unload’,
‘dismantle’, ‘be discharged’ and (uniquely) ‘be specified’ (<i>CAL</i>, s.v.).
In Syriac the meanings ‘remove’, ‘rescue, free’ and also ‘withdraw’
(intrans.) are widely recognised and Payne Smith (<i>CSD</i>, 464) also
gives ‘break off’ (<i>CAL</i> adds ‘disown’, ‘chatter’, ‘borrow money’,
‘dismantle’, presumably from the larger <i>Thesaurus</i>). <i>CAL</i> offers
‘redeem, dismantle’ as the main senses in Aramaic, perhaps because they
are in its analysis the most widely attested meanings. But ‘dismantle’
(i.e. ‘take to pieces’ [cf. above on MHeb.]) is likely to be a
particular instance of the broader sense ‘separate, remove’, which can
also be seen as the basis of the originally technical sense ‘redeem’.

[^rcm1]: <i>DNWSI</i>, 943, curiously distinguishing this lexeme from its other Aram. examples; the occurrence cited is the legal text presented in Fitzmyer and Harrington 1978:164-69 (64 i:10).
[^rcm2]: Examples of the latter in Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1239; cf. <i>CAL</i>, s.v., and van Zyl 1972.


<b>A.4</b>  The verb is comparatively rare in <i>East Semitic</i>, with only a few examples, with the sense ‘separate’ being cited (<i>AHw</i>, 829).


<b>A.5</b>  In <i>South Semitic</i>, Arabic <i>faraqa</i> means ‘separate, divide’, while
in Epigraphic South Arabian and Ethiopic the main sense is ‘set free’,
with ‘decide’ (Soq.) and ‘perforate’ (Tigre) being noted in Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small>,
1083, as isolated further meanings.

<span id="RCMB1"><b>B.1</b></span> It has been suggested that the basic meaning of <i>prq</i> is ‘split,
divide’ (<i>HAL</i>, 916; cf. Reiterer 2003:111), because of the occurrences
in Akkadian and Arabic. Certainly the appearance of these meanings in
such widely separated parts of the Semitic-speaking region is
noteworthy. But perhaps more weight should be given to the antiquity of
the sense ‘set free’ in South Semitic and the rarity of the verb in
Akkadian. The more extensive evidence in Aramaic especially, where
‘remove’ is more prevalent (as well as its likely specialised derivative
‘redeem’), should also be noted. The sense ‘loosen’, which probably lies
behind the Ugaritic occurrences and also appears in Aramaic, may well
derive from the same general idea. Be that as it may, it is not too
difficult to see a relationship between the broad groups of meanings
outlined so far, since all involve a basic idea of ‘coming apart’ by
some kind of decisive action. There are a few isolated senses which
occur in some languages, alongside the more widespread core of meanings,
but their explanation is best left as a problem for specialists in those
languages.

## 2. Formal Characteristics


<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is a triliteral strong verb.

## 3. Syntagmatics


<b>A.1</b>  The <i>subject</i> of <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in all forms is most often a human figure or
group: 

* Esau: Gen 27:40 (<i>qal</i>); 
* Laban: 4Q215 f1 3:2 (<i>qal</i>); 
* a hostile or friendly individual: Ps 7:3; Lam 5:8: in both cases a (nominalised?) part. <i>qal</i>; 
* the Israelite people: Exod 32:2 (<i>piel</i>); 32:3, 24 (<i>hithp.</i>). 

It may also be: 

* God: Ps 136:24 (<i>qal</i>);
* a non-human entity: 1 Kgs 19:11 (<i>piel</i>, <span dir="rtl">רוח</span>); Ezek 19:12 (<i>hithp.</i>, <span dir="rtl">מטה</span>, possibly
symbolising a human opponent; see <a href="#ExA2">Exegesis A.2</a>); Zech 11:16 (<i>piel</i>, <span dir="rtl">רֵעֶה</span>, ‘shepherd’).


<b>A.2</b>  The <i>object</i> of  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>, where specified (none explicit in Ps 7:3 and
Lam 5:8, but in both cases the speaker[s] is/are implied), may be: 

* human: Ps 136:24 (<i>qal</i>, ‘us’ = Israel); 4Q215 f1 3:2 (<i>qal</i>, ‘him’ = Ahiyot, the father of Bilhah and Zilpah); 
* most often a thing: Gen 27:40 (<i>qal</i>); Exod 32:2 (<i>piel</i>); 32:3, 24 (<i>hithp.</i>); 1 Kgs 19:11 (<i>piel</i>, <span dir="rtl">הרים</span>); Ezek 19:12 (<i>hithp.</i>); Zech 11:16 (<i>piel</i>).


<b>A.3</b>  In associated adverbial phrases the most common syntagm is  <span dir="rtl">מן</span>,
‘from’, followed by an expression referring to (part of) a person: Gen
27:40 (<span dir="rtl">מעל צוארך</span>); Ps 136:24 (<span dir="rtl">מצרינו</span>); Lam 5:8 (<span dir="rtl">מידם</span>), all with <i>qal</i>: a
similar separation is implied by phrases in the near context in Exod
32:2 (<span dir="rtl">אשׁר באזני נשׁיכם</span>), 3 (<span dir="rtl">אשׁר באזניהם</span>); 4Q215 f1 3:2 (<span dir="rtl">וילך בשׁבי</span>). In Ps
7:3  <span dir="rtl">פֹּרֵק</span> is associated with the expression  <span dir="rtl">כאריה</span> and the verb  <span dir="rtl">טרף</span>.

<b>A.1</b>  In most LXX renderings verbs meaning ‘remove, take apart’ are used:
only in Psalms and Lamentations does the middle of λυτρόω appear (for
the <i>qal</i>), implying the meaning ‘redeem, ransom’. In Ezek 19:12
ἐξεδικηθήσαν (Ziegler’s reading) most likely means ‘were punished’ or
‘suffered vengeance’ (<i>GELS</i>, 160) in view of the context and
Septuagintal usage elsewhere (esp. Zech 5:3): since ἐκδικέω often
represents  <span dir="rtl">פקד</span> (1 Kgdms 15:2; Hos 1:4, etc.; Zeph 1:8, etc.; Jer 15:3,
etc.; cf. also ἐκδίκησις for  <span dir="rtl">פקדה</span> in Ezek 9:1) the translator may well
have had or assumed a slightly different <i>Vorlage</i> (metathesis) which
would fit the underlying sense of the passage well.


<b>A.2</b>  The limited extant evidence from the Three points towards a tendency
to replace the divergent renderings with ‘physical’ verbs: hence διαλυω
or διαχέω/διαχύνω in Ezek 19:12 and whatever <span dir="rtl">ܕܦܫܚ</span> (<i>dpšḥ</i>) represents in Ps 7:3.


<b>A.3</b>  The Vulgate follows a similar tendency to give a physical rendering
of  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>, probably following Symmachus (and Tg?) in the contextually
appropriate use of <i>lacero</i> in Ps 7:3 (cf. <i>dilaceratio</i> in Nah 3:1 for
the noun  <span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>). But in Ps 136:24 and Lam 5:8 <i>redimo</i> retains the
sense given to  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> by LXX. In Ezek 19:12 the use of <i>marceo</i>, ‘to wither’,
is probably derived from the context.


<b>A.4</b>  In the Targumim Aram.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>, with its wide range of meaning, is used
in seven of the ten occurrences, though there is some variation in the
Pentateuch between the different texts. The occasional use of other
verbs may point to a recognition that BHeb.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> had some senses not
found in Aram., though it is hard to envisage this for  <span dir="rtl">עדי</span> <i>aph.</i>,
‘to remove’, in Gen 27:40. It is more probable with  <span dir="rtl">גמר</span> <i>pa.</i>, ‘destroy’,
 <span dir="rtl">טלטל</span> ith., ‘to be exiled’(?), and  <span dir="rtl">פשׁח</span>, ‘to strip, tear off’. The use of  <span dir="rtl">פכר</span>,
‘to split’ or ‘to break open’ (McNamara, Hayward and Maher 1994:128), in
Neofiti in Exod 32:2 is very odd, not only because of the divergence
from the other Targumim but because in the two following occurrences of
Heb.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in Exod 32 Neofiti like them has the Aram. equivalent. The verb
 <span dir="rtl">פכר</span> occurs only here in Neofiti and never in Onkelos or Jonathan, but it
is much more frequent in Pseudo-Jonathan, where it represents Heb.  <span dir="rtl">עקר</span>,
 <span dir="rtl">הרס</span>,  <span dir="rtl">נתץ</span> and  <span dir="rtl">כרת</span> <i>hiph.</i>, generally in relation to the destruction of
buildings (cf. also Qoh 3:3 Tg<small><sup>K</sup></small> for  <span dir="rtl">פרץ</span>). But it is not used by
Tg<small><sup>PsJ</sup></small> here and it would be more appropriate to some other occurrences
of Heb.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> than to this one. It is most likely a scribal error.


<b>A.5</b>  In the Peshitta too <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩ</span> (<i>prq</i>), with its wide range of meanings, was
generally found adequate (again in seven cases out of ten). The
exceptions are Gen 27:40 (<span dir="rtl">ܥܒܪ</span>), Exod 32:24 (<span dir="rtl">ܐܬܐ</span> <i>aph.</i>) and Zech
11:16 (<span dir="rtl">ܥܪܩ</span> <i>pa.</i>), but the sense given is similar.

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields


<b>A.1</b>  The varied uses of BHeb.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> are reflected in the wide range of
words which occur in parallel with it or in close proximity to it, as
well as those which are used in similar contexts elsewhere in BHeb.


<b>A.2</b>  In Gen 27:40  <span dir="rtl">רוד</span>, ‘to be restless, stray’ (rather than ‘to break free’
[Gunkel, Westermann, NRSV]), occurs in the preceding clause. Synonyms
for the ‘removal’ of a yoke are  <span dir="rtl">שׁבר</span> (Jer 2:20),  <span dir="rtl">סור</span> (Isa 14:25) and  <span dir="rtl">חתת</span> (Isa 9:3; see further Reiterer 2003:113).


<b>A.3</b>  In Exod 32  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is followed by  <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> (v. 24), while in comparable
passages  <span dir="rtl">סור</span> <i>hiph.</i> (Gen 35:2) and  <span dir="rtl">שׁית</span> (neg.),  <span dir="rtl">ירד</span> <i>hiph.</i> and  <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hithp.</i>
(all Exod 33:4-6) are used.


<b>A.4</b>  In 1 Kgs 19:11  <span dir="rtl">שׁבר</span> <i>piel</i> occurs in the following phrase, with a
similar object (<span dir="rtl">סלעים</span> ||  <span dir="rtl">הרים</span>).


<b>A.5</b>  In both Ezek 19:12 and Zech 11:16  <span dir="rtl">אכל</span> occurs in an adjacent clause,
although the contexts are otherwise somewhat different.


<b>A.6</b>  In Ps 7:3 as given by MT  <span dir="rtl">טרף</span> is a parallel expression and  <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i>
is an antonym.


<b>A.7</b>  By contrast in Lam 3:8  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> occurs in a phrase very similar to
<span dir="rtl">אֵין מַצִּיל</span> at the end of Ps 7:3 (cf. also, e.g., Judg 18:28 and other passages
in BDB, 664; with  <span dir="rtl">מושׁיע</span> Judg 12:3, etc.; BDB, 446). Likewise the context
in Ps 136:24 is very similar to Ps 44:8, where  <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> <i>hiph.</i> is used; cf.
Deut 33:7 (<span dir="rtl">עֵזֶר</span> +  <span dir="rtl">היה</span>).

## 6. Exegesis


<b>A.1</b>  The uses in Exod 32 are said to ‘assume strong resistance’, so that
there is a need for violence in the removal of the jewellery by the men
(v. 2: so Houtman 2000:636).

<span id="ExA2"><b>A.2</b></span> Violence is also implied in Gen 27:40, Ezek 19:12 and Zech 11:16,
where  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is used metaphorically of either the overthrow of political
power or (in Zech 11:16, part of a passage that is based on Ezek
34:1-10) of the cruel use of political power.[^ex1] 

[^ex1]: See Gunkel 1910:314; Westermann 1981:540 (with a comparison to 2 Kgs 8:20-22); Cooke 1936:210, 212, Zimmerli 1979:398; Rudolph 1976:201, 203; Petersen 1995:98-99.


<b>A.3</b>  Cogan appropriately renders the verb ‘rending’ in 1 Kgs 19:11 and
draws attention to comparable theophanic passages (2001:449, 453; on
theophany cf. Jeremias 1965); the association in the verse with
<span dir="rtl">שׁבר</span> - which Skinner (1910:373) notes to be an alternative to  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in the image
of Gen 27:40 - and the use of  <span dir="rtl">נתץ</span> with  <span dir="rtl">הצרים</span> in Nah 1:6 support such a rendering against the weaker ‘splitting’ of NRSV.


<b>A.4</b>  In Ps 5:7 too (see <a href="#TDB1">Text Doubtful</a>)  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is probably used as a
continuation of the violent animal metaphor in the first part of the
verse.[^ex2] 

[^ex2]: So Gunkel 1926:25; and even Briggs and Briggs 1907-09:52-53, 57, who prefer to emend with LXX.


<b>A.5</b>  There is good reason to carry over the idea of violent separation into the probably later (in the main) salvific use of the verb in Lam 5:8 and Ps 136:24 (a post-exilic psalm: cf. esp. v. 26), as Gunkel saw
(1926:577-78, ‘entriss’; so also Kraus 1978:1078-81).


<b>B.1</b>  In view of the clear evidence of a violent meaning it is a mistake to interpret occurrences of  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> on the basis of a predominantly positive
sense.[^ex3] 

[^ex3]: So Propp 2006:549, who sees the sense in Exod 32 as ironic; Provan 1991:129, who cites parallels in Judges (using <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> <i>hiph.</i>) without noting the difference; Kraus 1978:190-91, 194, who cites this as a reason for emending with LXX.


<b>B.2</b>  There is also no need to see the salvific use of the verb as due to
Aramaic influence (so BDB, 830, for Lam 5:8 and Ps 136:24), as it can be
explained adequately from the idea of violent removal found elsewhere.


<b>B.3</b>  Zimmerli’s attribution of  <span dir="rtl">התפרקו</span> (and  <span dir="rtl">ויבשׁו</span>) in Ezek 19:12 to
secondary redactional activity based on the symbolism of v. 11a (1979:391, 398) is improbable, as it does not explain the plural forms and the
meanings of the verbs do not fit  <span dir="rtl">מטה</span> as well as MT  <span dir="rtl">פריה</span> (taken
collectively) or the attractive emendation of it to  <span dir="rtl">בדיה</span> (cf. LXX<small><sup>Cat</sup></small> and, e.g., Cooke 1936:210, 212).


<b>B.4</b>  NEB’s rendering of Zech 11:16 by ‘and throw away their [REB: ‘the’]
broken bones’ (cf. Redditt 1995:127, though  <span dir="rtl">פרסיהם</span> is the object of
 <span dir="rtl">יפרק</span>, not the ‘subject’) is based on Driver’s unnecessary proposal that
 <span dir="rtl">פרס</span> here means ‘fragment’, like <i>pirsu</i> in Akkadian (1934:381). Driver
originally took  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in its normal sense of violent removal, with  <span dir="rtl">פרסיהם</span> representing the result of the action, hence ‘rend <i>in</i> pieces’.
Dissatisfaction with the syntax presupposed may have led the NEB
translators to adopt the unparalleled meaning ‘throw away’ for  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>. In
fact ‘tear off their hooves’ is a perfectly acceptable sense and reflects
the shepherd’s determination to consume every last piece of meat from
the animal.[^ex4] 

[^ex4]: So Rudolph 1976:201, 203, citing Dalman, <i>AuS,</i> 6:230; Petersen 1995:86, 88.

## 7. Conclusion


<b>A.1</b>  In BHeb.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> always refers to violent ‘removal’, with the
presupposition that there is some resistance to the action: hence it may
be translated ‘pull (off or away)’, ‘tear’ (off or away)’. In most cases
the object is not a person but a thing.


<b>A.2</b>  Occasionally it is used with a personal object (Ps 136:24; Lam 5:8;
4Q215 f1 3:2), where it joins the lexical field of ‘deliverance’; but
most likely even here it retains its sense of violent removal and is not
simply a synonym of (any of) the other lexemes in the group.


<b>A.3</b>  It is probably only in the <i>qal</i> that this salvific use developed (no
earlier than the Babylonian exile), though 4Q215 f1 3:2 could
theoretically be a <i>piel</i>. It is difficult to see any distinction of
meaning between the other occurrences of the <i>qal</i> and the <i>piel</i>, though
the <i>piel</i> in 1 Kgs 19:11 accompanies the <i>piel</i> of another verb in a
context of great upheavals in the natural world and it might therefore
imply an intensification of the meaning there. The opposition between
the <i>piel</i> and the <i>hithp.</i> in Exod 32 is probably due to the fact that
the <i>piel</i> in v. 2 denotes the action of (male) Israelite family heads in
relation to their dependants, whereas the <i>hithp.</i> in vv. 3 and 24
refers to the actions of these dependants themselves and so has a
reflexive component in its meaning. In Ezek 19:12, by contrast, the
<i>hithp.</i> must be used in a passive sense.


<b>B.1</b>  Suggestions, based on comparative philology, that the underlying
meaning of BHeb.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> is ‘break’ (Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 1131) or ‘split,
divide’ (see <a href="#RCMB1">Root and Comparative Material B.1</a>) do not correspond to
the majority of occurrences in BHeb. and should be discarded.


<b>B.2</b>  In a few places, where persons are the object, LXX and Vg render by
verbs meaning ‘redeem’. This is probably due to a semantic development
in Aramaic, perhaps combined with the theological interests of the
translators. The more widespread use of Aram.  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> in Tgs and Pesh need
not imply such an understanding of the Heb. in all cases, in view of the
many other meanings that  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> could bear in Aram. (cf. <a href="#RCMA3">Root and
Comparative Material A.3</a>
 and van Zyl 1972). There is no reason to
suppose that  <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> ever had the technical sense ‘redeem’ in BHeb.
