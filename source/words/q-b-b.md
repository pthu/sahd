## 7. Conclusion


<b>A.1</b> The verb <span dir="rtl" lang="he">קבב</span>, in view of the lexemes that are found in parallelism with it, and the contexts in which it is found, has the meaning ‘to curse’. We are unable to determine the precise nature of the act of cursing, and any suggestion that it is more of a ‘concrete’ act than in the case of other lexemes in the field in terms of the manner of its utterance cannot be substantiated.

<b>A.2</b> It seems probable that <span dir="rtl" lang="he">קבב</span> is originally a dialectal word, but that by the time of LBH the lexeme had been integrated with the Classical Hebrew vocabulary (Sir 41:7). In Sir it is clear that the meaning of the lexeme, as with many others in the field, had changed to that of ‘to reproach, chastise’. Perhaps <span dir="rtl" lang="he">קבב</span> began as a dialectal word for ‘to curse’ and over time came to be used in Heb. with the developed meaning, especially in poetic or sapiential literature. Its parallelism with <span dir="rtl" lang="he">זעם</span> in Prov 24:24 might suggest this.
