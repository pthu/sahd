## 1. Root and Comparative Material


<b>A.1</b>  In addition to possible cognate nouns noted in <a href="/words/pereq/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>, the lexica <i>s.v.</i> mention the following forms:  <span dir="rtl">מַפְרֶקֶת</span> in
post-biblical Heb. (Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 822, ‘neck, nape’; he also cites
there one occurrence of  <span dir="rtl">מַפְרֵק</span>, ‘joint’), Arab. <i>farq</i>, ‘Scheitel
[crown of the head]’ (<i>HAL</i>: 585); in Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small>, 719 Arab. <i>mafraq</i>, <i>mafriq</i>, ‘Kreuzung, Knotenpunkt’, <i>mafriq aš-šaʿr</i>, ‘Scheitel’, Soq. <i>fiqeriroh</i>, ‘Hals’, JAram. (Tgs.) <span dir="rtl">פר(י)קתא</span>, ‘Genick’ (‘back of the neck’, for this Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1228, refers to  <span dir="rtl">פירקתא</span>, [p. 1172], ‘joint’, always with a specifying genitive to mean ‘neck’: occurrences of the spellings cited in Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small> are noted as variants). 
[See also 
<a href="/words/p-r-q/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פרק</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a> and <a href="/words/pereq/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פֶּרֶק</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>.
In Ancient Hebrew the occurrence of
<span dir="rtl">פרק</span></a> in 4QpsEzek (4Q385 fr2:5-6; 4Q386 fr1 i:5) is particularly relevant; 
see <a href="https://sahd-online.com/words/paraq/#6-exegesis"><span dir="rtl">פָּרָק</span>: Exegesis A.2</a>.]

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  Noun: segholate fem. form of type <i>maqtāl</i> (BL, §77d, cf. §61eη, fη;
so <i>HAL</i>, but Ges<small><sup>18</sup></small> considers <i>maqtal</i> also possible [ibid.: §61aζ]).
While such forms might be expected to refer to the subject of the related verb, in fact they frequently refer to its object (e.g., <span dir="rtl">מאכל</span>,
<span dir="rtl">מתן</span>, <span dir="rtl">מלאכה</span>), so that ‘something divided or separated’, like the bones of the neck, is an entirely possible sense for this word.

## 3. Syntagmatics


<b>A.1</b>  <span dir="rtl">מפרקת</span> is the subject of  <span dir="rtl">שׁבר</span> <i>niph.</i>, ‘be broken’ (1 Sam 4:18).


<b>A.2</b>  In the immediate context this syntagm is preceded by <span dir="rtl">ויפל מעל־הכסא אחרנית</span>,
‘and he fell backward from his seat’,
and followed by <span dir="rtl">וימת</span>,
‘and he died’,
indicating cause and effect of the breaking.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek translations[^1] (αʹ, σʹ)</b>:

* νῶτος, ‘back (of body)’: 1 Sam 4:18<small><sup>LXX</sup></small>;
* τένων, ‘sinew, tendon’: 1 Sam 4:18<small><sup>αʹ</sup></small>;
* σπόνδυλος, ‘vertebra’: 1 Sam 4:18<small><sup>σʹ</sup></small>.

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܩܬܐ</span> (<i>pāraqṯā</i>), ‘neck, nape’: 1 Sam 4:18.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: J)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">(א)פקות</span>, ‘neck’: 1 Sam 4:18<small><sup>J</sup></small>.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>cervix</i> pl., ‘neck’: 1 Sam 4:18.


<b>A.1</b>  The renderings of Symmachus, Vg, Tg<small><sup>J</sup></small>
and Pesh all understand  <span dir="rtl">מפרקת</span> as ‘neck’. The use of the pl. form in Vg conforms to a classical idiom (Lewis and Short, <i>LD</i>, 322).


<b>B.1</b>  LXX’s νῶτος means ‘back’, not ‘neck’ (LSJ, 1187): the translator
probably made a guess from the context, not knowing the exact meaning of
this <i>hapax legomenon</i>, which would have been accurately rendered by
either αὐχήν or τράχηλος. [It is more surprising that LXX used νῶτος
several times for the better known synonym  <span dir="rtl">עֹרֶף</span> (2 Kgdms 22:41 = Ps
18:40; 4 Kgdms 17:14; Jer 2:27; 32:33; 48:39), but in those contexts
‘turning the back’ may have seemed the more natural Greek expression.
 <span dir="rtl">ערף</span> (like  <span dir="rtl">צואר</span>) is quite frequently translated by αὐχήν or τράχηλος
(including 3x in Jer), so that there seems to have been no ignorance of
its real meaning.] Aquila’s τένων is a general word for ‘sinew, tendon’
(LSJ, 1775), most often of the foot or ankle, but Homer, <i>Od.</i> 3:449, used
it of the neck tendons (of a sacrificial animal); cf. also Aquila at Ex
13:13; 34:20.


## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b>  The more common words for ‘neck’ are  <span dir="rtl">עֹרֶף</span> (33x BH, 1x Sir, 18x
Qumran; cf. <i>DCH</i> vi:565) and  <span dir="rtl">צַוָּאר</span> (41x BH, 1x Sir, 4x Qumran; cf.
<i>DCH</i> vii:91). Both these words are used of animals’ necks as well as
humans’, whereas  <span dir="rtl">מפרקת</span> refers to a human. Both of them are also used
figuratively, again unlike  <span dir="rtl">מפרקת</span>, but not much can be made of a single
occurrence. Neither of them seems to be used specifically of the bones
of the neck or as the object of  <span dir="rtl">שׁבר</span>, though Prov 29:1 (<span dir="rtl">ערף</span>) comes close
to this and the verb  <span dir="rtl">עָרַף</span> is used of breaking the neck of an animal (so
most authorities, but see Zipor 2001:369 for an alternative
interpretation). Despite the last-mentioned evidence, the general usage
of the other words may support the idea (for which there is etymological
support: see <a href="#RCM">Root and Comparative Material</a> above) that <span dir="rtl">מפרקת</span> meant the neck-bones specifically and that this was the reason for its selection in 1 Sam 4:18.

## 6. Exegesis


<b>A.1</b>  The commentaries and reference works are in no doubt about the
meaning of this word, and generally have little if anything to say about
it. But Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 1131, gave the meaning as ‘<i>vertebrae cervicis</i>
vel <i>dorsi</i> a frangendo dicta’ (cf. Robinson 1855:603: ‘pr. [properly]
the joints or vertebrae of the neck’). This is preferable to the more recent explanation cited below in B.1.

<b>B.1</b>  Smith (1904:36, ‘It means the neck as dividing [<span dir="rtl">פרק</span>] the head and
trunk’) and BDB, 830 (‘[<i>dividing</i> head from body]’), explain the meaning from the presumed active sense of <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>. But comparison with words of a similar form (see <a href="#FC">Formal Characteristics</a>) and the existence of
cognates meaning ‘joint’ (in the sense of a small bone) at Qumran as
well as in later Heb. and Aram. makes it at least as possible, and
perhaps more likely, that the meaning is ‘that which is divided (or
broken)’, which also fits the physical reality well (i.e., the vertebrae
that make up the ‘neck-bone’) [so Gesenius: see above].

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1.</b> Although this noun occurs only once in BHeb., the combined evidence of
later Heb. usage and the majority of the Versions makes the meaning
‘neck’, which fits the context well, virtually certain. A combination of
etymological parallels and the structure of the lexical field supports a
specific reference to the (human?) neck-bone(s).
