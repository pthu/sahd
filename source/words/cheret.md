## <span id="RCM">1. Root and Comparative Material</span>



<b>A.1</b> 
<i>Root.</i>
√<span dir="rtl">חרט</span> is considered a variant form of √<span dir="rtl">חרץ</span>, ‘to incise, engrave’ (Ges<sup>18</sup>, 396, 401; <i>CDG</i>, 264).

An original connection with 
√<span dir="rtl">חרת</span>, ‘to plough’ (Syr. √<span dir="rtl">ܚܪܬ</span> [<i>ḥrat</i>] also ‘hollow out’), Hebr. √<span dir="rtl">חרשׁ</span> I, ‘to plough’, and √<span dir="rtl">חרת</span>, ‘to incise, engrave’, is not excluded, but see the discussion in Williamson 2011, 364, and the references there for the word <span dir="rtl">חרת</span> (as it is used in 1QH<sup>a</sup> <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I</span>:24).



<b>A.2</b>
<i>Akkadian.</i>
<i>ḫarāṣu</i>, ‘to cut down, to cut off, to incise’ (<i>CAD</i>, Ḫ, 92); <i>maḫruṣu</i>, ‘graver, chisel, burin’ (<i>AEAD</i>, 58).



<b>A.3</b> 
<i>Ugaritic</i>.
<i>ḥrṣ</i>, ‘to cut, bite’ (?) (<i>DULAT</i><sup>3</sup>, 364-65). However, also Ugar. <i>ḥrẓn</i>, a PN of uncertain derivation, might be related.



<b>A.4</b> 
<i>Phoenician, Punic</i>.
<i>ḥrṭyt</i>, ‘sculpture’ (cult image in a temple, <i>PPD</i>, 196), but doubted by <i>DNWSI</i>, vol. 1, 404. See also <i>ḥrṣ</i>, ‘moat, canal’ and ‘carving, chiselling, carved work’ (<i>DNWSI</i>, vol. 1, 406-07).



<b>A.5</b> 
<i>Postbiblical Hebrew.</i>
<span dir="rtl">חרט</span>, ‘to chisel, model’ (Dalman, <i>ANHT</i>, 160; Jastrow, <i>501</i>); <span dir="rtl">חרט</span>, ‘to incise’; <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶץ</span>, ‘incision, groove’ (<i>WTM</i>, Bd. 2, 115; Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 505).



<b>A.6</b> 
<i>Jewish Aramaic.</i>
<span dir="rtl">חריץ</span>, ‘incision, groove’; <span dir="rtl">חרט</span>, ‘to cut into, dig’ (Levy, <i>WTM</i>, Bd. 2, 115; Sokoloff, </i>DJBA</i>, 484).



<b>A.7</b> 
<i>Samaritan Aramaic.</i>
<span dir="rtl">חרץ</span>, ‘to mutilate’; <span dir="rtl">ערק</span>, ‘opening’ (in the ark) (Tal, <i>DSA</i>, 296).



<b>A.8</b>
<i>Syriac.</i> 
<span dir="rtl">ܚܪܛܐ</span> (<i>ḥūrāṭā</i>), ‘cutting, laceration’; <span dir="rtl">ܚܪܛ</span> (<i>ḥ<sup>e</sup>raṭ</i>), ‘to scrape, scratch, make incisions’; <span dir="rtl">ܚܪܛܐ</span> (<i>ḥarṭā</i>), ‘gash, scratch’ (Payne Smith, <i>CSD</i>, 134, 157;
Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 489; Brockelmann, <i>LS</i>, 256).



<b>A.9</b> 
<i>Classical Arabic.</i>
<i>ḥaraṣa</i>, ‘to rend, cleave’ (Lane, 547), less likely <i>ḫaraṭa</i>, ‘to peel, rub off’ (Lane, 723), though this is also attested as ‘to cut off’ (<i>SDA</i>, t. 1, 362).



<b>A.10</b> 
<i>Greek.</i>
χάραγμα, ‘any mark engraved, character’; χαρακτήρ, ‘graving tool, mark engraved, character’; χαράσσω, ‘to whet, cut into, engrave’ (<i>LSJ</i>, 1976-80), may ultimately go back on Semitic <i>ḥrṣ</i> because the Greeks learned how to write from the Semitic world.





## <span id="FC">2. Formal Characteristics</span>





<b>A.1</b> 
Both in Exod 32:4 and in Isa 8:1 the word is spelled as <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>. Also in the texts from the Qumran there is no variation in the spelling of <span dir="rtl">חרט</span>.
	


## <span id="Syn">3. Syntagmatics</span>



<b>A.1</b>
Only the singular form of <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> is attested in the Hebrew Bible.



<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> occurs as <i>nomen regens</i> of
<span dir="rtl">אנושׁ</span>, ‘man’ (Isa 8:1),
<span dir="rtl">חיים</span>, ‘life’ (1Q33 XII:3), and
<span dir="rtl">זהב</span>, ‘gold’ (4Q382 fr25:4).


<b>A.3</b> <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> is preceded by the preposition
<span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> in Exod 32:4, Isa 8:1, 1Q33 XII:3, and 4Q382 fr25:4. In three cases, the preposition
<span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> introduces the instrument with which the action is performed; <span dir="rtl">יצר</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to shape’, in Exod 32:4;
<span dir="rtl">כתב</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to write’, in Isa 8:1;
<span dir="rtl">חרת</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to engrave’, in 11Q33 XII:3.


<b>B.1</b> In 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> VII:18, the preposition <span dir="rtl">ב</span> is written above the line with the text of Isa 8:1.


## <span id="AV">4. Ancient Versions</span>


<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions:</b> 


* γραφίς, ‘stylus, chisel’:
Exod 32:4; Isa 8:1;


* τέχνη, ‘skill, art’:[^2]
Exod 32:4 (according to ἄλλος: see <a href="#AVa2">Ancient Versions A.2 </a>).


<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh):</b>


* <span dir="rtl">ܛܘܦܣܐ</span>
(<i>ṭūpsā</i>), ‘mold’:[^3] Deut 32:4;


* <span dir="rtl">ܟܬܒܐ</span>
(<i>kṯābā</i>), ‘script’:[^4] 
Isa 8:1.



<b>c. Targumim (Tg): </b>

* <span dir="rtl">זיפא</span>, ‘pitch, mold’:[^5]
Exod 32:4 (Tg<sup>O</sup>);


* <span dir="rtl">טופסא</span>, ‘mold, framework’:[^6]
Exod 32:4 (Tg<sup>N,PsJ</sup>);


* <span dir="rtl">כתב</span>, ‘script, writing’:[^7]
Isa 8:1.



<b>d. Vulgate (Vg):</b> 


* <i>opere fusorio</i>, ‘foundry-work’:[^8]
Exod 32:4;


* <i>stilo</i>, ‘stylus’:[^9]
Isa 8:1.



<b>A.1</b> 
For Exodus 32:4 the corresponding passage in LXX clearly expresses the idea of 
giving the essential shape (πλάσσω) to the idol with the 
help of a stylus or chisel (γραφίς, cf. <i>GELS-L</i>, 93).


<span id="AVa2"><b>A.2</b> </span>
In the Hexaplaric tradition, a reference to other translations of the word in Exod 32:4 are cited thus: ἄλλος ἐν τέχνῃ.[^10]
Exod 32:4 in Syro-Hexapla (Vööbus 1975) has <span dir="rtl">ܒܪܘܫܡܐ</span> <i>brūšāmā</i>, ‘sign, mark’,[^11], this variant is also given by Field transliterated in Greek script.
The Syro-Hexaplaric rendering of the word in Isa 8:1 is <span dir="rtl">ܒܟܬܝܒܬܐ</span> <i>bkṯiḇṯā</i>, ‘writing, script, written characters’.[^12].



<b>A.3</b> The Samaritan targum of Exod 32:4 has <span dir="rtl">מרכי</span>, ‘trough, mold’.
One Samaritan MS contains the following supralinear annotations to that word: <span dir="rtl">בזיפה</span>, <span dir="rtl">בזפיתה</span>, <span dir="rtl">בציאף</span>, and <span dir="rtl">בטופרין</span> (Tal, <i>DSA</i>, 835). 



<b>A.4</b>
In Exod 32:4 Pesh presents a connection between the verb <span dir="rtl">ܨܘܪ</span> (<i>ṣwr</i>), ‘to form, shape’ (Payne Smith, <i>CSD</i>, 476), and the Greek loanword <span dir="rtl">ܛܘܦܣܐ</span> (<i>ṭūpsā</i>), ‘type, model, or mold’. It appears that Pesh has understood <span dir="rtl">חרט</span> as a mold, possibly under the influence of the Palestinian Targum (see above <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>) and perhaps Sam.
In Isa 8:1 Pesh has <span dir="rtl">ܒܟܬܒܐ ܕܐܢܫܐ</span> <i>bkṯābā dnāšā</i>, ‘in human script’. The two passages, Exod 32:4 and Isa 8:1, together render it likely that the Syriac translator did not know what to do with the Hebrew word <span dir="rtl">חרט</span>, but was acquainted with the Palestinian exegetical traditions about its meaning.



<b>A.5</b> 
Tg<sup>O</sup> renders <span dir="rtl">וצר יתיה בזיפא</span>, ‘and he shaped it with pitch’, in Exod 32:4, apparently interpreting the verb as a form of <span dir="rtl">צור</span>, ‘to shape’ (Dalman, <i>ANHT</i>, 361), and assuming that the cast was hollow because in antiquity pitch was used to achieve a hollow shape (see the literature cited under <a href="#Exe-lit">Textual Evidence</a> A.1.).
Tg<sup>N</sup> has <span dir="rtl">ורמה יתה בטופסא</span>, ‘and he cast it in a mould’. Tg<sup>PsJ</sup> has a double rendering, <span dir="rtl">וצר יתיה בשושיפא ורמא יתיה בטופרסא</span>, ‘and he shaped it in a cloth and cast it in a mould’.
In Isa. 8:1 the Targumist avoids the difficult <span dir="rtl">חרט</span> by rendering <span dir="rtl">וכתוב עלוהי כתב מפרש</span>, ‘and write on it in clearly readable script’.



## <span id="LSF">5. Lexical/Semantic Fields</span>


<b>A.1</b> 
The word <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> is used in two occasions: in Exod 32:4 Aaron was brought the broken golden rings of the people. These were made with a <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> into a molten calf. In Isa 8:1 this tool with the adjective ‘human’ is used to write down the words <span dir="rtl">מַהֵר שָׁלָל חָשׁ בַּז</span> on a <span dir="rtl">גִּלָּיוֹן גָּדוֹל</span>.



## <span id="Exe">6. Exegesis</span>





### <span id="Exe-lit">6.1 Textual Evidence</span>



<b>A.1</b>
The word <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> is rendered most commonly as ‘graving tool’ or ‘stylus’ (BDB, 354-55: ‘graving-tool, stylus’; Klein, <i>CEDHL</i>, 232: ‘graving tool, stylus’; <i>HWAT</i>, 223: ‘1. Griffel; 2. Meißel’; GB, 259: Isa. 8:1 ‘Griffel z. Eingraben’, Exod. 32:4 ‘Meissel ... unwahrsch.’; Ges<sup>18</sup>, 396: Isa. 8:1 ‘Griffel, übertr. Schrift’, Exod. 32:4 ‘Griffel od. Meißel’ (?); <i>HAL</i>, 339: Isa. 8:1 ‘Griffel’, Exod. 32:4; </i>MHH</i>, 351: <span dir="rtl">מפלסת</span>, <span dir="rtl">אזמל</span> (‘chisel, adze’); <i>TLB</i>, vol. 3, 248: ‘chisel, graving-tool’; Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>: ‘stylus, scalprum’ (?)), or just as ‘stylus’ (<i>DCH</i>, vol. 3, 316: ‘stylus’), or ‘graving tool’ (Zorell, 268: ‘scalprum’); ‘chisel’ (Zhakevich, 135).
Others have <i>DBHE</i>, 255: Exod. 32:4 ‘Cincel, estilo’; Isa. 8:1 ‘Por metonimia, lo escrito o grabado’; <i>HCHAT</i>, Bd. 1, 438: Isa. 8:1 ‘Griffel ... Menschengriffel, d.h. mit vulgären, gewöhnlichen Schriftzügen’ as, Exod. 32:4 ‘Meisel’ oder besser ‘Beutel’; (<i>HAWAT</i>, 125:  Exod. 32:4 ‘Schabewerkzeug 2. synekd. speziell: Griffel zum Einritzen’. There is some variation in the renderings chosen by English translations: 
Exod 32:4 ‘mold’ NRSV; ‘graving tool’ KJV, ESV, ASV, and JPS; ‘engraving tool’ NASB; ‘tool’ ISV. Isa 8:1 ‘common characters’ NRSV, ESV; ‘a man’s pen’ KJV; ‘pen of a man’ ASV; ‘common script’ JPS; ‘ordinary letters’ NASB; ‘stylus pen’ ISV.



<b>A.2</b>
The meaning of <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> in Exod 32:4 is disputed. Houtman 2000 enumerates no less than six different interpretations and finally prefers to render <span dir="rtl">וַיָּצַר אֹתוֹ בַּחֶרֶט</span> as ‘(Aaron) tied the (gold) in a cloth’ (similarly <i>HCHAT</i>, Bd. 1, 438; Loewenstamm 1967; 1975; Gevirtz 1984, and others), because he believes that a rendering like ‘he shaped it with a <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>’ requires a repointing of the Hebrew. However, this is an unnecessary assumption if one accepts the existence of a √<span dir="rtl">צור</span> III, ‘to draw, design, shape, form’, that is also attested in several other Semitic languages (cf. Childs 1974; Schroer 1987; <i>HAL</i>, 952; <i>DCH</i>, vol. 7, 107) and is supported by the <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>. The hypothesis that <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> should be regarded as a cloth bag or purse (identical to or repointed as 
→ <span dir="rtl">חָרִיט</span>, for which 2~Kgs 5:23 is invoked) leaves unexplained how the gold became an image of cast metal (<span dir="rtl">מַסֵּכָה</span>). The assumption of a miracle has no basis in the text.


<b>A.3</b>
It is highly unlikely that the chief priest Aaron himself would have engaged in the specialist’s work of casting a molten image of a bull-calf (on the techniques required see e.g. <i>SAT</i>, vol. 8, 105-95; M. Weippert, in: <i>BRL</i><sup>2</sup>, 219-24; <i>AMMI</i>, 216-40; J. Ogden in: <i>AEMT</i>, 161-66; <i>MMHB</i>, 231-35). Small images of cast metal bulls and bull-calves have been found in many places in Israel and the neighbouring countries, but Exod 32:2-3 and 32:19-20 create the impression that it was a big image which would have complicated the smith’s task considerably. Therefore it is more likely that it was the writer’s intention to indicate that it was Aaron who commisioned and outlined the shape of the calf with a <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>, whereas others did the actual casting, probably in the form of gold sheets which were subsequently hammered into shape over a wooden base (cf. Exod 31:1-11; 35:30-36:1 and <i>MMHB</i>, 234).
If this was the case, the <span dir="rtl">עשׂה</span>, ‘he made it’, of Exod 32:4, 35 must be understood as ‘he had it made’, as was the oriental way of giving the employer all the credit for building or making things (see the building inscriptions of many kings, Baal’s boast to have built his palace in <i>KTU</i> 1.4:<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">VI</span>.35-37 whereas actually it was built by the technician among the gods Kotharu, and for the OT, e.g. 1 Kgs 10:12, 16, 18; 12:28, 31-32; 16:33 and especially 2 Kgs 16:10-11). So <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> in Exod 32:4 is most likely a burin or stylus with which one could draw a sketch of an object on a writing tablet (for a similar interpretation, cf. Propp 2006: 549-50).


<b>A.4</b>
According to Isa 8:1 the prophet has to write characters on a large object (→ <a href="/words/gillayon/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">גִּלָּיוֹן</span></a>) with a <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט אֱנושׁ</span>, ‘a man’s <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>’ (i.e., a normal tool, as distinct from the finer jeweller’s tool). Such a tool was commonly used for making notes on a wax or clay tablet, or to mark jars (after firing), weapons and tools with indications of ownership. 
Since the lettering on the to be displayed object had to be clearly readable to all passers-by it may be assumed that a <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> was a rather thick engraving tool, a burin or stylus.
Discussing the translation of <span dir="rtl">גִּלָּיוֹן</span> might establish the meaning of <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>. Translating <span dir="rtl">גִּלָּיוֹן</span> as ‘mirror’ (see Van der Toorn 2007, see below <a href="#Exe-litb1">Textual Evidence B.1</a>; see also Van Wieringen, 
<a href="/words/gillayon/"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">גִּלָּיוֹן</span></a>)
or as ‘papyrus’, ‘parchment’, or ‘scroll’ (among others VanDyke 2022: 227, see below <a href="#Exe-litb2">Textual Evidence B.2</a>), is difficult to reconcile with writing on it with a stylus or burin. Equally so, the word is not related to √<span dir="rtl">גלל</span>, ‘to roll’ (for a discussion → <span dir="rtl">גִּלָּיוֹן</span> and cf. Williamson 2011: 360).


<b>A.5</b>
It might be interesting to point to its Akkadian cognate <i>galālu</i>, which is a West-Semitic loanword in Akkadian for a polished stone out of which <i>stelae</i>, a doorpost, and mortars were made (</i>CAD</i> G, 11), or to the Aramaic <span dir="rtl">גלל</span> (Ezra 5:8; 6:4), cf. also the the mortars made out of chert unearthed in Persepolis on which the inscription <span dir="rtl">אבן גלל</span>, ‘<i>gll</i> stone’, is engraved).


<b>A.6</b>
One may infer <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>, because of its receptor in Isa 8:1 (<span dir="rtl">גִּלָּיוֹן</span>), that the <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> must have been robust enough to incise at least chert stone (or building objects, see Williamson 2011: 362 who refers to a Palmyrene Aramaic example). 


<b>A.7</b>
In the Bab. Talmud tractate Avodah Zarah 22b, an instrument used to split a <i>gll</i>-stone (<span dir="rtl">גללא ברע</span>) is called a <span dir="rtl">מכתבא</span>, an Aramaic word which is interpreted as ‘awl’ (Greenfield 2001: 254). 



<span id="Exe-litb1"><b>B.1</b> </span>
Both terms are thus set into relationship of each other: on a <span dir="rtl">גִּלָּיוֹן</span> one could write with a <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>. If it was a mirror of bronze on which Isaiah wrote, as has been suggested, the stylus must have been harder than that metal and therefore it may have had a point of iron or sapphire (cf. Jer. 17:1). There is certainly no basis for Van der Toorn’s guess that a <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט אֱנושׁ</span> would have been a ‘brush’ (Van der Toorn 2007: 180, 336).



<span id="Exe-litb2"><b>B.2</b> </span>
VanDyke 2022 interprets <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> in Exod 32:4 as a tool to make a sketch of an object (here, a calf), and translates the word as ‘rush-pen’. She points to the fact that the object of the verb <span dir="rtl">יָּצַר</span> changes within Exod 32:3-4, here the presumed object of <span dir="rtl">אֹתוֹ וַיָּצַר</span> (in vs. 4 set in masculine singular) is the plural <span dir="rtl">נִזְמֵי הַזָּהָב</span> (vs. 3a). But the object of the suffix in vs. 4 could also point to either the molten earrings or the people, or simply denote a step not mentioned to arrive from ‘golden earrings’ to a ‘calf’.





### <span id="Exe-fig">6.2 Figurative Use</span>



<b>A.1</b>
The <span dir="rtl">חרט חיים</span> in 1Q33 XII:3 <span dir="rtl">וברית שלומכה חרתה למו בחרט חיים</span>, ‘and the covenant of your peace you engraved for them with the stylus of life’, may denote the engraving devise used by God which seems deliberately lacking in Exod 32:16 <span dir="rtl">מִכְתַּב אֱלֹהִים ה֔וּא חָרוּת עַל־הַלֻּחֹת</span>, ‘the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets’. 



### <span id="Exe-ico">6.3 Pictorial Material</span>


<b>A.1</b>
On Neo-Assyrian murals frequently a pair of scribes is depicted, of which one is writing on a tablet and another writing on other material (for instance parchment). See Figure 1.

### <span id="Exe-ar">6.4 Archaeology</span>
<b>A.1</b>
Chisels or bronze awls, presumably also to be used as engraving tools, are found in many excavations in Egypt and the Levant (<i>AEMT</i>, 356), for example see Figure 2.

## <span id="Con">7. Conclusion</span>





<b>A.1</b>
Because the Old Testament provides the scholar with but two instances, the meaning of the word <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span> depends mainly on its context. Though in this case the two instances are very
different, ‘stylus’ may be taken as the basic meaning of the word under discussion. Several ancient versions, an important passage in a Qumran text, as well as the most likely etymology support this choice which makes good sense in each of the passages quoted. The word belongs to the small category of technical terms (→<span dir="rtl">עֵט</span>, →<span dir="rtl">צִפֹּרֶן</span>, →<span dir="rtl">ְקֶסֶת</span>, →<span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶד</span>, →<span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span>), the basic function of which is either the essential shaping of artefacts or the writing of characters.
