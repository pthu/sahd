### Text doubtful:

B.1 <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹם</span> in the MT of Num 3:49 is presumably intended as a by-form of <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> (for nouns with afformative  <span dir="rtl">ם</span>-, see GK §85t). But it is more
likely a corruption of <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span> (cf. Sam) by metathesis in the consonantal text.

Qere/Ketiv: none

<b>A.1</b> See 
<a href="/words/p-d-h/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פדה</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>.


## 2. Formal Characteristics

<span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> is a
<i>qitlān</i> form (or <i>qatalān</i>); see Joüon and Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §88Mb-c.

## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> is the subject of the verbs <span dir="rtl">יקר</span>, ‘to be precious’, and <span dir="rtl">חדל</span>, ‘to be lacking’ (Ps 49:9).

<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> is the object of the verb <span dir="rtl">נתן</span>, ‘to give’ (Exod 21:30).

<b>A.3</b>   <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> is nomen regens of  <span dir="rtl">נַפְשׁוֹ</span>, ‘his life’, referring to the victim of a goring-ox (Exod 21:30) and of <span dir="rtl">נַפְשָׁם</span>, ‘their life’ (Ps 49:9), subject not specified, but ‘human beings’ is implied by 49:8.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX)</b>:

* λύτρον, ‘sum payable as ransom’ pl.: Exod 21:30;
* λύτρωσις, ‘act of redemption’: Ps 49:9.

<b>A.1</b>  The two renderings divide equally between ‘price of redemption’ and ‘act of redemption’.

<b>B.1</b>  According to Field ἄλλος, ‘another’, represented <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> in Ps 49:9 by ἀντίλυτρον, but as he observes this is more likely to be a displaced
rendering of  <span dir="rtl">כֹּפֶר</span> in v. 8.

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܦܘܪܩܢܐ</span> (<i>purqānā</i>), ‘salvation, redemption’: Exod 21:30; Ps 49:9.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: O/N/PsJ/K)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">פורקנא</span>, ‘redemption, salvation’: Exod 21:30<small><sup>O,N,PsJ</sup></small>;
Ps 49:9<small><sup>K</sup></small>.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>pretium</i>, ‘price’: Exod 21:30;
* <i>pretium redemptionis</i>, ‘redemption price’: Ps 49:9.

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields


<b>A.1</b>  See <a href="/words/p-d-h/#5-lexicalsemantic-fields"><span dir="rtl">פדה</span>: Lexical/Semantic Fields</a>.


<b>A.2</b>  <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> is closely associated with  <span dir="rtl">כפר</span>, ‘ransom price’ (Exod 21:30, Ps 49:8-9), which has its usual non-cultic sense.

## 6. Exegesis


<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> (Exod 21:30; Ps 49:9) seems to be synonymous with <span dir="rtl">פדוים</span>, although both times it occurs specifically with <span dir="rtl">נפשׁ</span>. Exod 21:30
concerns the owner of a dangerous ox which has not been kept secure and has killed a human. The owner is subject to the death penalty, but he may be allowed to pay a ransom. This practice is found elsewhere in the
Ancient Near East, in the Laws of Eshnunna (§54) and in the Code of Hammurapi (§251). The <span dir="rtl">פדיון</span> (ransom) therefore, is the price (<span dir="rtl">כפר</span>) a man must pay for the
victim’s life. In Ps 49:9, <span dir="rtl">פדיון</span> also seems to mean ‘price’, although it is in a different context. Psalm 49 is a Wisdom Psalm on life and death, particularly focussing on wealth and power. It clearly states that a brother cannot redeem (<span dir="rtl">פדה</span>) a man (Ps 49:8). He cannot give God his price (<span dir="rtl">כפרו</span>), which is presumably his ransom price. <span dir="rtl">פדיון</span> then qualifies <span dir="rtl">כפרו</span> in the preceding verse. In the face of death, wealth will not help you, for the value (<span dir="rtl">פדיון</span>) of (eternal) life (v. 9) is too great – it is something which only God can give (v. 15). This use of <span dir="rtl">פדיון</span> is very similar to the socio-legal usage and leads to an almost literal understanding of God paying a ransom price to the power of Sheol, which is not found explicitly elsewhere in the HB (but cf. Hos 13:14).

<b>A.2</b>  The contexts suggest that while the emphasis of <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is on the power of redemption/to redeem and it is always used in relation to God, <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> on the other hand is used with human subjects. It denotes an actual ransom ‘price’ given in exchange for life (Exod 21:30), as is
 <span dir="rtl">פדוים</span> in Num 3:46-51.

## 7. Conclusion

 <span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> means the price that is paid for the redemption of a life. Neither of its two occurrences is in a cultic context. This contrasts with the wholly cultic use of <span dir="rtl">פדוים</span>.
