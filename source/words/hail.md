### Text Doubtful

<b>A.1</b> The lexeme <span dir="rtl">בֶּרֵד</span> (LXX Βαραδ) occurs once as a toponym (Gen 16:14, pausal <span dir="rtl">בָּרֵד</span>), and once as a personal name (1 Chron 7:20). These occurrences are not taken into consideration for the semantic analysis.

<b>A.2</b>  The denominative verb <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> appears only in Isa 32:19: 
<span dir="rtl">וּבָרַד בְּרֶדֶת הַיָּעַר</span>. The verb is supposed to mean ‘to hail’ (<i>DCH</i> ii:259; <i>HALOT</i>, 154) and a
literal but strange translation of the phrase in Isa 32:19 could be ‘and it will hail in the descending of the forest’. 
The ancient translations interpret <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> as the noun <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span>:[^1]
LXX: ἡ δὲ χάλαζα ἐὰν καταβῇ, ‘and if hail descends’ (<i>NETS</i>); α'σ': καὶ χαλαζα ἐν τή καταβάσει τοῦ δρυμοῦ, ‘and hail in the descend of the forest’; Pesh: 
<span dir="rtl">ܘܒܪܕܐ ܢܚܘܬ ܥܠ ܥܒܐ</span> (<i>wbrdʾ ḥwt ʿl ʿbʾ</i>), ‘and hail will descend on the forest’; Tg: <span dir="rtl">וְיֵחוֹת בַרדָא</span>, ‘then will descend hail’; Vg: <i>grando autem in descension saltus</i>, ‘but the hail in the descent of the forest’. 1QIsa<sup><small>a</small></sup> reads the same consonantal text <span dir="rtl">וברד ברדת היער</span>.   
The Hebrew text is often regarded as corrupt. It has been proposed to read <span dir="rtl">וירד</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">וברד</span> ‘then the forest will descend while descending’ (Wildberger 1982:1274; cf. BHS: 1ms MT  <span dir="rtl">וירד</span>). However, Reymond (1958:25) and Blenkinsopp (2000:432) still interpret <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> as a verbal form and retain the meaning ‘to hail’.

<b>A.3</b>  Ps 18:14<sup><small>MT</small></sup> reads as follows: 
<span dir="rtl">‏וַיַּרְעֵם בַּשָּׁמַיִם יְֽהוָ֗ה וְעֶלְיוֹן יִתֵּן קֹלוֹ בָּרָד וְגַחֲלֵי־אֵשׁ</span>, ‘and YHWH thundered from heaven; Elyon gave forth his voice; hail and coals of fire’.
The final colon  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד וְגַֽחֲלֵי־אֵֽשׁ</span> ‘hail and coals of fire’, also occurs at the end of Ps 18:13.
The colon is missing in the translation of LXX
(17:14<sup><small>LXX</small></sup>), but is attested in: Tg <span dir="rtl">ברדא וגומרין די נור</span> ‘hail and coals of fire’;
Pesh <span dir="rtl">ܒܪܕܐ ܘܓܘܡܪ̈ܐ ܕܢܘܪܐ</span> (<i>brdʾ wgwmrʾ dnwrʾ</i>), ‘hail and coals of fire’; Vg: <i>grando et carbone ignis</i>, ‘hail and coals of fire’.
Ps 18:14 corresponds partially with the parallel verse 2 Sam 22:14, but there the final colon <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד וְגַחֲלֵי־אֵשׁ</span> is absent.

<b>A.4</b> Ms B presents Sir 32:10 in two forms, plus a marginal note: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span dir="rtl">לפני ברד ינצח ברק ולפני דכא ינצח חן</span>,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘lightning flashes before a hailstorm and favor is shown forth upon the contrite.’   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span dir="rtl">לפני ברד ינצח ברק ולפני בושי חן</span>,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘lightning flashes before a hailstorm and favor is shown forth upon those who feel shame.’

Marginal note: <span dir="rtl">בררי נצח ברד</span>, ‘flashed hailstorm’. The wordplay with <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> and  <span dir="rtl">ברק</span> suggests that ‘hail’ is original here. Pesh lacks the verse, while LXX has no equivalent for 
<span dir="rtl">ברד</span>, ‘hail’.

<b>A.5</b>  There are different readings between Sir 43:13<sup><small>M</small></sup>; 43:15<sup><small>M</small></sup> and 43:13<sup><small>B</small></sup>. The Masada Scroll shows  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> in Sir 43:13<sup><small>M</small></sup> and Sir 43:15<sup><small>M</small></sup>. In the Cairo Genizah ms B, Sir 43:13<sup><small>B</small></sup> occurs <span dir="rtl">ברק</span> instead of  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> while Sir 43:15<sup><small>B</small></sup> is not preserved. The different versions read as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 43:13<sup><small>M</small></sup>: <span dir="rtl">גערתו [תתו]ה̊ ברד</span>, ‘his rebuke marks out the hail’.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 43:13<sup><small>B-<i>text</i></small></sup>: <span dir="rtl">גבורתו תתוה ברק</span>, ‘his strength marks out the thunder’.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 43:13<sup><small>B-<i>marg</i></small></sup>: <span dir="rtl">גערתו תתוה בקר</span>, ‘his rebuke marks out the morning’.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 43:13<sup><small>LXX</small></sup>: προστάγματι αὐτοῦ κατέσπευσεν χιόνα, ‘by his ordinance he urges on snow’.

This verse fits into a passage in which the various elements of weather are described as expression of the divine. God manifests his rebuke trough natural elements, like hail, clouds, and thunder. We can compare Sir 43:13 with Ps 8:8-16, a lucid example of the majestic and disruptive power of YHWH.   
According to Yadin (1999:189) the reading of Sir 43:13<sup><small>B</small></sup> is more appropriate and the author of the Masada Scroll may have miscopied, reading <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> on the basis of Sir 43:15 (<span dir="rtl">גבורתו חזק ענן ותגדע א̊ב̊ני ברד</span>, ‘Clouds derive their strength from his might and his might fells the hailstones’). To deepen the question, as pointed by Shean and di Lella  (1987:493), we should observe the next verse:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 43:14<sup><small>B-<i>text</i></small></sup>: 
<span dir="rtl">למען ברא אוצ[…]ויעף[…]</span>,[^1a]   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’he created the storehouse for the sake of […] and makes fly … ’  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 43:14<sup><small>M</i></small></sup>: 
<span dir="rtl">למענו פרא אוצר ויעף עבים כעיט</span>,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘for his own purpose he let loose the storehouse and made clouds fly like birds of prey’.

According to the text, natural forces are stored in a ‘depository’, and if that storehouse is loosed the elements will fly out of it and they are unleashed on the earth. There are several references to ‘storehouses’ of meteorological elements. In Deut 28:12  <span dir="rtl">מָטָר</span>, ‘rain’ is released from 
<span dir="rtl">אֶת־אוֹצָרוֹ הַטּוֹב אֶת־הַשָּׁמַיִם</span>, ‘his rich  storehouse, the heavens’. 
Jer 51:16 speaks of <span dir="rtl">וַיּוֹצֵא רוּחַ מֵאֹצְרֹתָיו</span>, ‘and brings the wind out
of his storehouse’. Job 38:22 speaks of  <span dir="rtl">אֹצְרוֹת שָׁלֶג וְאוֹצְרוֹת בָּרָד</span> ‘storehouses of
snow and storehouses of hail’. The next verse in the Masada scroll has:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 43:15<sup><small>M</i></small></sup>: <span dir="rtl">גבורתו חזק ענן ותגדע א֗ב֗ני ברד</span>,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘His strength buttresses (lit., strengthens) clouds and splinters hailstones’.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43:15<sup><small>LXX</i></small></sup>: ἐν μεγαλείῳ αὐτοῦ ἴσχυσεν νεφέλας, 	καὶ διεθρύβησαν,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘In his majesty he made clouds strong,		and stones of hail were broken apart.’

According to Yadin (1999:189) the Masada scroll’s reading of Sir 43:15 is correct on the basis of the Greek version. Furthermore, the genitive construction  <span dir="rtl">אבנ(י) (ה)ברד</span> is attested (Josh 10:11; Isa 30:30) and also the collocation of  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span>, ‘hail’ and  <span dir="rtl">ענן</span>.CHECK (not in Acc.)   
Reading the entire sequence of Sir 43:13-15 it seems to have more sense to read  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> in both verses, because the hailstones and the clouds of Sir 43:15 are a consequence of the divine rebuke in Sir 43:13, that led to unleashing the elements from the storehouse.

<b>A.6</b>  The word  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> is also attested in 4Q204 1vi:21; 4Q204 1vi:23; 4Q216 5:7; 4Q222 3:2. Regarding 4Q216 5:7 and 4Q222 3:2 scholars have suggested a reconstruction on the basis of the Book of
Jubilees. 4Q216 5:7 is reconstructed on Jub 2:1-4 and mentions all the natural phenomena created by God. 4Q222 3:2 reflects Jub 48:5. The passage lists the ten plagues sent on Egypt by God (DJD XIII). For 
4Q204 1vi:21 and 4Q204 1vi:23 
scholars have suggested a reconstruction based on I Enoch 13:6-14:16 (<i>DSS.SE</i>, 147):  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> is mentioned with other natural
phenomena (snow and lightning), but is not intended properly in a meteorological meaning, instead it seems to refer to building material and it is translated as ‘hailstones’. In both of the occurrences the lexeme seems to refer to a wall: 4Q204 1vi:21 mention a wall made of hailstones, and 4Q204 mentions a house made of hailstones, probably referring to a wall built with hailstones. These passages are not taken into consideration for the analysis, due to their references to an apocryphal book. CHECK (no argument, concerns Hebrew words).

<b>A.7</b>  Another noun for hail is  <span dir="rtl">אֶלְגָּבִישׁ</span>, which occurs only
in Ezekiel (Ez 13:11, 13; 38:22).

## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  In East Semitic Languages <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> is not present as a substantive. 
Although Koehler and Baumgartner (KBL, 147) mentioned the Akk. verb <i>baradu</i> ‘to be vexatious’, this word is not found in the Akk. dictionaries (cf. <i>CAD</i>; Black et al. 2000) while <i>HALOT</i> has no Akk. reference anymore.[^2]

<b>A.2</b> <i>Middle Hebrew, Old Aramaic</i> <span dir="rtl”>[ב]רד</span>, ‘hail’[^3]; 
<span dir="rtl">אבני ב[רד]</span>] in KAI 222A:26.

<b>A.3</b> <i>Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic</i>:  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span>, ‘hail’.[^4]

<b>A.4</b> <i>Mandaic</i>:  <span dir="rtl">בַּרְדָא</span> <i>barda</i>, ‘cold, hail’.[^5]

<b>A.5</b> <i>Syriac</i> <span dir="rtl">ܒܰܪܕܳܐ</span>,  ‘hail’;[^syr] New Syriac <i>berda</i>, ‘hail’.[^nsyr]

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> is a primary noun with <i>qatal</i> form (BL, 461, §61m″).

<b>A.2</b> It’s worth to mention here the Canaanite shift, caused
Proto-NW-Semitic \*<i>ā</i> to turn into \*<i>ō</i>. Suchard (2020:72) refers to a shift <i>ā</i> > <i>å</i> and points out that in Hebrew there are a number of <i>qāṭāl</i> isolated nouns and most of them are semantically related and fall into the lexical field of weather, like  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span>, ‘hail’,  <span dir="rtl">ברק</span>, ‘lightning’,  <span dir="rtl">ענן</span>, ‘cloud cover’, and  <span dir="rtl">מטר</span>, ‘rain’ (Fox 2003:163).

## 5. Lexical Semantic Field

<b>A.1</b>  Both in the Bible and in Qumran scrolls <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> is often found in parallelism or close association with other terms concerning the weather:

*  <span dir="rtl">שָׁלֶג</span>, ‘snow’: Ps 148:8; Job 38:22; 4Q381 fr14+5:2; 4Q473 fr2:6;
*  <span dir="rtl">מָטָר</span>, ‘rain’: Exod 9:33, 34;

*  <span dir="rtl">זֶרֶם</span>, ‘downpour’: Isa 30:30;
*  <span dir="rtl">רוּחַ</span>, ‘wind’: Ps 148:8;
*  <span dir="rtl">קִיטוֹר</span>, ‘fog’: Ps 148:8;
*  <span dir="rtl">בָרָק</span>, ‘lightning’: Sir 32:10<sup><small>B</small></sup>;
*  <span dir="rtl">עָנָן</span>, ‘cloud’: Sir 43:15<sup><small>M</small></sup>; 4Q381 fr14+5:2;
*  <span dir="rtl">עבים</span>, ‘clouds’: 4Q381 fr14+5:2.

<b>A.2</b> Besides the lexical field of the meteorological phenomena  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> is found in close relationship with terms referring to natural phenomena related to water and to fire:

*  <span dir="rtl">מַיִם</span>, ‘water’: Isa 28:17;
*  <span dir="rtl">חֲנָמַל</span>, ‘flood’: Ps 78:47; 4Q 422 3:10;
*  <span dir="rtl">קֶרַח</span>, ‘ice’: 4Q473 2:6;
*  <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>, ‘fire’: Es 9:23, 24; Pss 105:32; 148:8; Sir 39:29<sup><small>B</small></sup>;
*  <span dir="rtl">לַהַב אֵשׁ אוֹכֵלָה</span>, ‘flame of devouring fire’: Isa 30:30;
*  <span dir="rtl">רְשָׁפִים</span>, ‘flame’: Ps 78:48;
*  <span dir="rtl">גַחֲלֵי</span>- <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>, ‘coals of fire’: Ps 18:13, 14.

<b>A.3</b> In a number of passages  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> is found in close association with terms related to decay and disease:

*  <span dir="rtl">שִּׁדָּפוֹן</span>, ‘blasting’ and  <span dir="rtl">יֵּרָקוֹן</span>, ‘mildew’: Hag 2:17, both terms refer to a disease of the grain;
*  <span dir="rtl">יֵּרָקוֹן</span>, ‘mildew’: 4Q473 2, 6
*  <span dir="rtl">רַע וָדָבֶר</span>, ‘misery and pestilence’: Sir 39:29<sup><small>B</small></sup>

<b>A.4</b> In Isa 28:2 there is a similitude,  <span dir="rtl">כְּזֶרֶם בָּרָד שַׂעַר קָטֶב כְּזֶרֶם מַיִם כַּבִּירִים שֹׁטְפִים</span>,  ‘like a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction, a storm of mighty overflowing waters’. It is probable that these constructions are synonymous and could be part of the same lexical field.

<b>A.5</b>  Even in Mishna and Tosefta the word <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> occurs together with <span dir="rtl">שלג</span>, ‘snow’ (Mishna Mikva’ot 7:1; Mishna Oholot 8:5, Tosefta Oholot 14:6). In these passages  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> also occurs with  <span dir="rtl">כפור</span>, ‘frosted dew’, <span dir="rtl">גליד</span>, ‘ice’,  <span dir="rtl">מלח</span>, ‘salt’ (only in Mishna) and <span dir="rtl">מים</span>, ‘water’ (only in Tosefta). According to the context it is clear that ‘hail’ here is intended as a natural phenomenon.

## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b> Due to the context where the word appears and the meaning of the cognates, we can assume that the interpretation of <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> as ‘hail’ is pretty certain. Even if ‘hail’ is often accompanied by fire, stones, thunder and other disruptive phenomena, it seems made of water, as suggested by a similitude in Isa 28:2 and parallelism in Exod 9:33 and Isa 28:17. Also in Mishna Mikva’ot 7, 1  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> is mentioned among materials that can raise the mikveh up to the right quantity and do not make it invalid.

<b>A.2</b> Hail, as natural phenomenon, occurs only as the result of violent turbulence in fully developed cumulo-nimbus clouds and is accompanied by severe thunderstorms. Raindrops within the cloud are carried to great heights where the temperature is below 0° C, and the ice pellets grow in size as they are carried up and down. When they eventually fall to earth, they may be hailstones, a half to one inch in diameter, capable of damaging field crops and even of injuring men and animals. In exceptional conditions they may be even larger (DB, 336). Winter storms are often accompanied by hail and according to Efrat and Orni (1971:146) about 70% of the rainfall in Israel falls from November to February with January being both the wettest and the coldest month.

<b>A.3</b>  Hail is, in all of the context, a manifestation of the power of God, and none of the occurrences is considered benignant. Hail is punitive, destructive and disruptive, and manifest itself as a plague (Exodus 9), as a punishment (Hag 2:17; Sir 39:29<sup><small>B</small></sup> and 4Q473), as theophany and as demonstration of a majestic divine power (in most cases against enemies).

<b>A.4</b>  The lexeme  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> is mentioned rather frequently in the Old Testament and it is strongly connected to the plague tradition of Exodus 9: the 7th Egypt plague is a violent hailstorm bringing devastation and destruction for the crops and the harvest and animals and people that are in the fields. In Egypt, however, hail is extremely rare and therefore the plague of the hail inflicted to the Pharaoh by Moses cannot be regarded as natural phenomenon but must have of preternatural nature (Exod 9:18–19, 22-26, 28-29, 33-34; Pss 78:47; 105:32; 4Q422).


<b>A.5</b>  In Jos 10:11; Isa 28:2, 17; 30:30 and Ps 18:13-14 the hail is a sign of divine power unleashed against the enemies of Israel. In Jos 10:11 we found  <span dir="rtl">אַבְנֵי הַבָּרָד</span>, ‘hailstones’. In the context God provides victory for Israel against his enemies. It is clear that the victory is due to the divine power that manifest itself with disruptive natural and meteorological phenomena. There is, indeed, a cooperation between Joshua and God. The hailstones which killed the Amorites in Jos 10:11 must have come from an exceptionally heavy cumulo-nimbus which had covered the sun. It is important to note that, according to Efrat and Orni (1971:155), ‘the coastal Plain has an average of five to eight days of hail per year, mostly in midwinter’, so it seems to be an unusual and unseasonable hailstorm.  
In Isa 28:2, 17 this woe saying is directed against Samaria and its political leaders. The fate of the city by the hand of the Assyrian is alluded in the expressive metaphor of a violent storm, recurring often in the book, in Isa 28:17 and 30:30 (Blenkinsopp 2000:387). In Is 28:2 it’s found the construct state  <span dir="rtl">זֶרֶם בָּרָד</span>, ‘hail downpour’, which is in parallelism with  <span dir="rtl">זֶרֶם מַיִם</span>, ‘water downpour’: it emphasizes the disruptive nature of this specific atmospheric phenomenon, the hail. Even in Isa 28:17 there is a parallelism between <span dir="rtl">בָרָד</span>, ‘hail’ and <span dir="rtl">מַיִם</span>, ‘water’. According to the context and the semantic relationship with these two terms, the catastrophic and violent force of the meteorological elements is highlighted and strengthened by this parallelism.   
In Isa 30:30 <span dir="rtl">בָרָד</span>, ‘hail’ occurs together with  <span dir="rtl">נֶפֶץ</span>, ‘cloudburst’,
<span dir="rtl">זֶרֶם</span>, ‘downpour’ and  <span dir="rtl">לַהַב אֵשׁ אוֹכֵלָה</span>, ‘flame of devouring fire’. The violence of the atmospheric agents is defined by the close relationship between the terms. Again, all the power of the meteorological elements is unleashed by God against an enemy, Assyria in this case.   
In Isa 30:30 and Ps 18:13–14 theophany is announced by  <span dir="rtl">קֹלוֹ</span>, ‘his voice’, the voice of the divine. The manifestation of the divine power is an act of speech. Mostly the voice of God is represented by a thunder, but in a number of specific case the divine voice has the power to afflict the weather (see also Exod 9:28; 1 Sam 7:10; 2 Sam 22:14; Jer 10:13; 51, 16, Job 37:5).

<b>A.6</b>  In a specific passage <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> is mentioned with <span dir="rtl">בַּשִׁדָפוֹן וּבַיֵּרָקוֹן</span>, ‘blight, mildew and hail’ (Hag 2:17).[^17]
The meaning of  <span dir="rtl">שִׁדָפוֹן</span> and <span dir="rtl">יֵּרָקוֹן</span> is debated, but both terms refer to diseases that affect grain and grapes before harvest. In fact, they are in close association with hail, that is one of the agent used by God to attack a nation’s agricultural goods, especially on crops in the fields before harvest (Petersen 1985:92). This passage recalls Amos 4:9 and Deut 28:22, in which appears both <span dir="rtl">שִּׁדָּפוֹן</span>, ‘blight’ and  <span dir="rtl">יֵּרָקוֹן</span>, ‘mildew’, but not <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span>, ‘hail’. However, the context of these three passages presents similarity: ‘blight’, ‘mildew’ and ‘hail’ are punishment inflicted by God. Even in 4Q473 ‘blight’ appears as a plague in 
co-occurrence with hail, snow, and ice.

<b>A.7</b>  In a number of passages  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> appears in close relationship with ‘fire’ and ‘flames’: Exod 9:23, 24; Isa 30:30; Pss 18:13, 14; 78:48; 105:32; 148:8; Sir 39:29<sup><small>B</small></sup>. The contexts refer to Egypt plague, theophany and retribution. According to Wiggins (2014:71) in Psalms all of the occurrences of ‘fire’ and ‘flames’ connected to  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> need to be read as ‘lightning’, because there is no hail without a thunderstorm. However, the hail in the Old Testament is not a natural phenomenon, instead it is a divine phenomenon, and it is not unlikely that it can occurs also with proper fire. In two specific passages, Isa 30:30 and Sir 39:29<sup><small>B</small></sup>, the disruptive force of the element is a manifestation of the anger of God.

<b>A.8</b> The recurring expression  <span dir="rtl">אַבְנֵי הַבָּרָד</span> (Jos 10:11; Isa 30:30; Sir 43:15<sup><small>M</small></sup>) is usually translated as ‘hailstone’. Fensham (1963:169) suggests translating as ‘thunder-stone’, because in Isa 30:30 hailstones are mentioned along with lightning, cloudburst and tempest. However, the topic of ‘hailstones’ is found also in  the Sefire Treaty, in which there is a wish that hailstones may shower on Arpad (Fitzmyer, 1995:181, 185). In Assyrian <i>abnu</i> ‘stone’ is attested, which is used in a construct state, even if it’s not found with <i>brd</i> in the dictionaries (<i>CAD</i> A<sup><small>I</small></sup>, 60). In Standard Babylonian the expression ‘hailstone’ occurs once.[^18] It can be related with the Hebrew construct  <span dir="rtl">אַבְנֵי הַבָּרָד</span>, ‘hailstones’ (Jos 10:11; Isa 30:30; Sir 43:15<sup><small>M</small></sup>).

<b>A.9</b>  As said previously, hail is one of the plagues sent to Egypt and is a typical phenomenon of the theophany of God against the enemies of Israel (Jos 10:11; Isa 28:2; 28:17; 30:30; Ps 18:13-14). According to Propp (1999:351) and Dozeman (2009:235) the hail is more typical of Canaan than of Egypt and through this YHWH manifest himself as Storm God. The imagery of the Storm God is common in ancient Mesopotamia and in Syria-Palestine, because thunderstorm is central to the agricultural cycle.   
Mythological and epic texts from Ugarit mention the deity <i>Baʽal</i>/ <i>Hadad</i> (these two names are often found in parallelism). He is called ‘the Storm God’ as inscribed on a statue from Alalah.[^19] His representations include images of fertility and control of the weather: Baal brings forth life through the storm rains, but also wages war to his enemies with his lightning bolts. The thunderstorm is an event of revelation, a celebration of life, and a proclamation of political victory and power (<i>ANET</i>, 129-42).  
<span dir="rtl">ברד</span> is also supposed to be a name of an ancient deity of the Canaanite pantheon. References are found in Eblaitic God <i>Baradu madu</i>, who is a personification of the hail. In the Eblaite texts, <i>Baradu madu</i> receives sacrificial offering, so he is probably a minor deity of the Eblaite pantheon or a specific manifestation of the Storm God, <i>Baʽal</i>/ <i>Hadad</i> (<i>DDD</i>, 304-05).  
The vassal treaties of Esarhaddon (<i>ANET</i>, 534-41), an Assyrian text, mentions the deity <i>Hadad</i>, who manifest his power with plagues which reminds of the Egypt plagues: violent downpour and locust that destroy all the crops.

<b>A.10</b> The fragment 4Q473 contains the word <span dir="rtl">ברד</span> (partially restored). The context probably refers to a punishment from God. 4Q473 2:6 is part of a parabiblical fragment, similar to Deuteronomy 28. 4Q473 contains Deuteronomic material and scholars have suggested a reconstruction of 4Q473 2:6 based on plagues mentioned in Exodus 9:  <span dir="rtl">וירקון שלג קרח וברד</span>, ‘and blight, snow, ice and hail’. 4Q473 is a lucid example of blessing and curses literature, that is also found in other fragments of the Qumran corpus. This fragment fits in the theme of the two ways, a recurring theme in the Old Testament and in the later Jewish and Christian texts (DJD XIII:289-294).   
4Q422 3:10 is a paraphrase of the sequence of plagues in Exodus and presents resemblances with both Pss 78 and 105. All the plagues but boils are mentioned, even if they are presented in different order than in the Book of Exodus, with darkness before hail and not after locust (as in Exodus).[^20]

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>  The context in which  <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> appears is mostly a theophany or a retribution inflicted by YHWH to enemies or ‘sinners’. The hail has in no context a positive connotation: the hail brings destruction and disasters and when it manifests it is often associated with other meteorological terms like  <span dir="rtl">שָׁלֶג</span>, ‘snow’ or <span dir="rtl">קֹלוֹת</span>, ‘thunder’; or natural terms like <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>, ‘fire’.  
The lexeme seems to have, indeed, a negative implication: when the hail comes, it may destroy crops and hurts people and, in the text, the disruptive strength of this phenomenon is clearly described. It is perfectly plausible that a similar phenomenon is connected with the divine force.

<b>A.2</b>  The lexeme occurs mainly in Early Biblical Hebrew and from the contexts it is clear that the hail is a divine phenomenon, even if it is connected to the natural environment. We have no occurrences in which the hail is intended as stand-alone phenomenon, not connected with the divine will.[^22] 

<b>A.3</b>  As we’ve seen before, the way in which YHWH reveal his destroying power through the hail is similar to the theophany of the Tempest God of the other ancient Near Eastern religions. This is one of the aspects of divine features: the ability to control a meteorological phenomenon that is not usual in this area and that, certainly, makes people afraid of losing crops and harvests. Giving the power to control the hail to God may have been a way to exorcise the fear.
