<b>A.1</b>
In Exod 27:4b (and again inv. 5b) possibly <span dir="rtl">הַמִּכְבַּר</span> should be read instead of <span dir="rtl">הָרֶשֶׁת</span> in agreement with the parallel Exod 38:5 (<span dir="rtl">הַנְּחֹשֶׁת</span> <span dir="rtl">לְמִכְבַּר</span>), and with LXX and Pesh (see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>).



## 1. <a id="RCM"></a>Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>
<i>Root:</i>
<span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> is evidently a <i>miqtal</i> form of √<i>kbr</i>. This root can have various meanings in the Semitic languages[^1] but the two basic meanings are ‘to be many’ (Syriac) and ‘to braid, plait’, also ‘to sieve’. Nouns of the <i>miqtal</i> type often designate utensils.[^2] Since <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> seems to be more or less comparable to <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span> ‘net’, only cognates that come close to this semantic field are cited below. 

<b>A.2</b>
<i>Egyptian:</i>
A somewhat exotic proposal was presented by Görg: ‘Could it be possible to see within <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> the combination of two Egyptian elements, the noun <i>mk</i> ... ‘‘covering’’ and the 
Egyptian connection <i>bj3 rw-d</i> ‘‘bronze’’?’.[^3] 

<b>A.3</b>
<i>Ugaritic:</i>
<i>kbrt</i>, ‘sieve’.[^4]

<b>A.4</b>
<i>Biblical Hebrew:</i>
<span dir="rtl">כְּבִיר</span> ‘mosquito net’; <span dir="rtl">כְּבָרָה</span>, ‘sieve’. The meaning of <span dir="rtl">מַכְבֵּר</span> in 2 Kgs 8:15 is uncertain, but is mostly described as ‘coarsely-woven cover  over a well head’ (cf. <span dir="rtl">מָּסָךְ</span> in 2 Sam 17:19).

<b>A.5</b>
<i>Postbiblical Hebrew:</i>
<span dir="rtl">כְּבָרָה</span> ‘Sieb, eig. Flechtwerk von Weiden’[^5]; <span dir="rtl">מַכְבֵּר</span>, ‘Geflecht, Flechtwerk von Weiden’.[^6]

<b>A.6</b>
<i>Ethiopic:</i>
Geez <i>kabaro</i> and <i>karabo</i>, ‘woven basket’.[^7]



## 2. Formal Characteristics

## <a id="AV"></a>4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuagint (LXX) and other Greek versions (αʹ, σʹ, θʹ)</b>:  

* ἐσχάρα, ‘hearth’, or ‘<i>grid</i> or <i>lattice-work</i> forming the base of various structures’:[^7a] Exod 27:4;  
(→ <span dir="rtl">אַח</span>), I. 1. ‘hearth, fireplace’; 2. ‘pan of coals, brazier’; II. ‘sacrificial hearth’; III. ‘fire-stick’; IV. 1. ‘platform, stand, basis’; 2. ‘grating’;[^8] ‘grate, grating’ (Exod 27:4) and ‘hearth, fire-place’ (Prov 26:21);[^9] <i>La Bible d’Alexandrie</i>, however, translates with ‘foyer’ (hearth) also in Exod 27:4 (bis). In Exod 27:4b, 5a.b LXX also reads ἐσχάρα for MT <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span> (vv. 4b, 5b) and <span dir="rtl">כַּרְכֹּב</span> (5a; with αὐτοὺς [scil. δακτυλίους, v. 4] for MT <span dir="rtl">אֹתָהּ</span>[^11]).  
* παράθεμα, ‘appendage’:[^14] Exod 38:4 (LXX 38:24).  
In the parallel Exod 38:4-5 (= LXX 38:24), however, <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> is rendered both times with παράθεμα, ‘appendage’ (<i>hapax leg.</i>, it seems);[^12] ‘sth put alongside sth, an appendage’;[^13]  ‘garniture’ &lt;garniture de foyer = ‘fire-irons’?&gt;;[^16] ‘a kind of trestle’.[^16] Here <span dir="rtl">כַּרְכֹּב</span> is rendered πυρείον, [plur.] ‘fire-sticks’; ‘earthen pan’ [Exod. 27:3];[^17] ‘censer’;[^18] ‘censer’;[^19] ‘brasero’ (brazier).[^20]
Omission: 35:16 (LXX 35:17, shortened verse); 38:5, 30.
Origineel:
Exod 39:39 is entirely lacking in LXX (in LXX the text of Exod 36-40 is much shorter than in MT and its order is different[^21]).


<b>b.  Peshitta (Pesh):</b>  

* <span dir="rtl">ܒܣܣ</span> (<i>basis</i> < βάσις), ‘base’: Exod 35:16; 38:5;  
* <span dir="rtl">ܩܪܩܠ</span> (<i>qarqel</i>), ‘grated cover’:[^25] Exod 27:4; 38:4, 30; 39:39;   <i>craticula</i>;[^23] ‘<i>a grating’</i>;[^24]  Latin <i>cracli</i>, a vulgar form of <i>clatri, clathri</i> which in turn was borrowed from Greek κλείθρα / κλῆθρα ‘bars, fences’.[^26]  

In Exod 27:4b, 5b Pesh also uses <span dir="rtl">ܩܪܩܠ</span> (<i>qarqel</i>) for MT <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span>, cf. LXX.  

<b>c. Targumim (Tg):</b>  

* <span dir="rtl">סְרָדָא</span>, ‘???’: all instances  Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small>;  1. ‘network, grate’; 2. ‘web with wide meshes, sail, hanging’;[^27] 1. ‘Drahtgeflecht, Drahtsieb’; 2. ‘Gitter’ (Exod 38:4).[^28]
* <span dir="rtl">קנק(י)ל</span>, ‘???’: all instances Tg<small><sup>N</sup></small> andTg<small><sup>PsJ</sup></small>; a loan from Greek κιγκλίς ‘lattice, latticed gate’.
* <span dir="rtl">מכבר</span>: all instances Tg<small><sup>Smr</sup></small>; so the Heb. word <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> is left untranslated.[^22]
<!--Info Sam Tg klopt voor A en J!-->

<b>d.  Vulgate (Vg):</b>  

* Exod 27:4; 35:16; 38:4, 30 <i>craticula</i> ‘fine hurdle-work, small giridion’, derived from <i>cratis</i> ‘wicker-work, hurdle’.[^29] In Exod 27:5b Vg
also has <i>craticula</i> for MT <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span>, cf. LXX and Pesh; in 27:4b it reads <i>per cuius</i> (= <i>retis</i>?). 
Exod 38:5 and 39:39 <i>retiaculum </i> ‘a little net, net-work, lattice-work’.[^30]

## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Textual Evidence

<b>A.1</b>
Within the TeNaKh, <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> only figures in the second half of the book of Exodus, in the description of the altar of the tabernacle (<span dir="rtl">מִשְׁכָּן</span> ‘dwelling place’, Exod 25:9; 26:1, etc): once (27:4) in the building instruction, the other five times in the building report itself (Exod 35-40). In Exod 27:1-8 the instruction is given to Moses to build the (SP, LXX: an) altar (<span dir="rtl">מִזְבֵּחַ</span>) of acacia wood (<span dir="rtl">שִׁטִּים</span> <span dir="rtl">עֲצֵי</span>), square (<span dir="rtl">רָבוּעַ</span>), five by five cubits, with a height of three cubits (about 2.50 x 2.50 x 1.50 meters), as a hollow chest (<span dir="rtl">לֻחֹת</span> <span dir="rtl">נְבוּב</span>, v. 8), with horns (<span dir="rtl">קְּּרָנֹות</span>) on its four corners and overlaid with bronze. The summing up of the utensils required (v. 3) is followed in v. 4 by the order to make for the altar a <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span>, further defined as ‘a network of bronze’ (<span dir="rtl">נְחֹשֶׁת</span> <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span> <span dir="rtl">מַעֲשֵׂה</span> → <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span>), with four bronze rings (<span dir="rtl">נְחֹשֶׁת</span> <span dir="rtl">טַבְּעֹת</span>, → <span dir="rtl">טַבַּעַת</span>) at its four corners, through which on both sides the poles (<span dir="rtl">בַּדִּים</span>, → <span dir="rtl">בַּד</span>) should be put for carrying the altar (vv. 6-7). As to the fastening of the <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> it is said in v. 5, that it should be ‘placed’ (<span dir="rtl">אֹתָהּ</span> <span dir="rtl">וְנָתַתָֹּה</span> - does the feminine suffix point to <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span>?) under the ledge (<span dir="rtl">כַּרְכֹּב</span>) of the altar from below (<span dir="rtl">מִלְּמָטָּה</span>). The net shall extend (upwards?) to halfway the altar, v. 5b. Although it is not stated explicitly, it may be assumed that it was hooked on the altar so that the altar could be carried by the poles through the rings fastened to the <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span>. Such portable altars are attested in ancient Egypt.

<b>A.2</b>
Thus the <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> together with the rings and poles, forms the carrying system for the (portable) altar itself. Possibly the grating had the shape of a basket, if we assume that it continued under the bottom of the altar, although this is not clearly indicated in the text. The meaning of <span dir="rtl">כַּרְכֹּב</span> is not certain, but it is usually conceived as a rim or ledge (Fr.: corniche, Germ.: Sims).

<b>A.3</b>
The <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> is mentioned again in Exod 35:16 in the list of items for which a ‘contribution’ (or: ‘offering’, <span dir="rtl">תְֹּרוּמָה</span>, Exod 35:5) was asked, ‘the altar of the burnt offering, with its accompanying  <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> of bronze (<span dir="rtl">אֲשֶׁר&thinsp;־לֹו</span> <span dir="rtl">הַנְּחֹשֶׁת</span> <span dir="rtl">וְאֶת&thinsp;־מִכְבַּר</span>), its poles, and all its utensils’. In Exod 38:4-5  <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> is found in the building account of the altar, which is a repetition of 27:4-5 (in the order 4a-5-4b); in 38:5 <span dir="rtl">הַנְּחֹשֶׁת</span> <span dir="rtl">לְמִכְבַּר</span> is read, instead of MT <span dir="rtl">עַל&thinsp;־הָרֶשֶׁת</span> in 27:4b, as the object on which the four bronze rings were fastened (see above).  

<b>A.4</b>
The last two occurrences of <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> are in lists similar to that of 35:16, always using exactly the same expression, ‘and its accompanying bronze <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span>’. In Exod 38:30, in the list of items made of bronze, it is preceded by ‘(and) the altar of bronze’ (i.e. its covering) and followed 
by ‘and all the utensils of the altar’; and in 39:39, in the final presentation to Moses of the tabernacle and all its parts, the preceding part is exactly the same as in 38:30, ‘the altar of bronze’, whereas it is followed, as in 35:16, by ‘its poles and all its utensils’. 

<b>A.5</b>
The somewhat vague descriptions of the altar in the Priestly Code are presumably based on memories of the altar in the Solomonic temple. Although a bronze altar is mentioned in 1 Kgs 8:64 as being too small for king Solomon to bring his consecration offerings on, it is significantly absent in the building account of the temple (1 Kgs 6 and 7:13-51); only a small altar, overlaid with gold, is mentioned as belonging to the inner sanctuary (1 Kgs 6:20, 22; cf. 7:48). The reason for this could be that already David built an altar to the Lord on Araunah’s threshing floor (2 Sam 24:25; cf. vv. 18, 21). Perhaps the altar which Solomon built, mentioned in 1 Kgs 9:25 (cf. 2 Chron 8:12-13), was in fact David’s altar refurbished by his son.[^31] Alternatively its omission from 1 Kgs 7 might be explained as a simple scribal error.[^32] 

<b>A.6</b>
According to Chronicles Solomon made his burnt offerings on the high place of Gibeon 
upon ‘the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made’ (2 Chron 1:5); in the Chronicler’s version of the building of the temple both an altar of bronze, about fifty times as big as that of the tabernacle, and the golden 
altar are briefly mentioned (2 Chron 4:1, 19). Moreover, king Ahaz ordered the building of a new altar, modelled after an altar he had seen in Damascus; the bronze altar was moved to the north side of his new altar ‘for me to inquire by’ (2 Kgs 16:10-16). Finally, in Ezekiel’s vision of the new temple, a description of an altar has been inserted (Ezek 43:13-17). In none of these passages a <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> is mentioned.  

<span id="Qum"><b>A.7</b></span>
<i>Dead Sea Scrolls:</i>
The phrase <span dir="rtl">ויעשו למזבח מכבר</span> in 4Q365 (fr12a-b.ii:11) corrseponds with the phrase <span dir="rtl">ויעש למזבח מכבר</span> in Exod 38:4 MT.
In 11Q19 iii:15 the altar of the new temple is mentioned and the <span dir="rtl">מכבר</span> is described as being positioned ‘on top of it’
(<span dir="rtl">וׄהׄמׄכׄב֯ר֯ א[שר] מלמעלה ל[ו]</span> as against <span dir="rtl">מלמטה</span>  of Exod 27:5 MT). This is important evidence showing that at that time the <span dir="rtl">מכבר</span>  was seen as a structure <i>on</i> the altar.



### 6.2 Pictorial Material

<b>A.1</b> 
In <i>The New Bible Dictionary</i> a reconstruction is given of the altar described in ‘Lv’ &lt;<i>sic</i>&gt; 27:1-8, inclusive of the <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span>.[^33] According to Kitchen  there exist Egyptian examples of portable shrines.[^34] Böhl points to the portable altars which the Assyrian kings took with them on their campaigns;[^35] according to Fensham, pictures of these exist.[^36]

<b>A.2</b> 
Although portable altars are attested in Antiquity, no clear parallel of the <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> has been encountered on any of them. However, an Aramaic stela from Zincirli shows a high administrator Katamuwa during a (posthumous) sacrificial meal. In one hand he has a cup of wine and in the other a leg of lamb which is also mentioned in the inscription. The crisscross pattern on the leg of lamb unmistakably indicates that it was roasted on a grating (Fig. 1).

### 6.3 Archaeology

<b>A.1</b> 
Houtman mentions altars of similar size excavated in Beersheba and Arad
(Houtman 2000:447).
Nowack (1992)experiments with wood and copper/bronze and their results.   
[More will be added later.



## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b>
All evidence points to the meaning ‘grating’ (Gitterwerk;<i> craticula)</i> for <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span>. Moreover, it is specified as a <span dir="rtl">רֶשֶׁת</span>, a network. As the altar was already overlaid with bronze, this extra 
bronze protection seems somewhat superfluous. Some scholars see its function as keeping lay-people from contact with the holy altar.[^40] 
The translation with ἐσχάρα in LXX Exod 27:4 could refer to an interpretation of <span dir="rtl">מִכְבָּר</span> as ‘hearth’.[^41] 
According to Houtman, 27:4-5 LXX deals with the making of the fire plate of the altar. The <i>craticula</i> of Vg is to be regarded as the grate or grill in the altar (Houtman 2000:443-44).
 

<b>A.2</b>
It seems to me that its main purpose was to serve as a carrying instrument, possibly in the shape of a basket, in combination with the rings and the poles. Perhaps, when at standstill, it could be turned upside down over the ledge instead of under it, so that it could function as a cover on the hollow wooden structure, and serve as a grate: the offering could be brought on its surface - but this is pure speculation.
For other possible interpretations, see Houtman (2000:444-46).
