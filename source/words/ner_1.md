## 6. Exegesis

### 6.1 Textual Evidence


<b>A.1</b>
With the exception of Prov 31:18 the literal use 
is confined to passages dealing with articles of 
sanctuary furniture. The texts with its 
figurative use, however, also contribute to the 
understanding of the literal use.


The lamp’s function is to light, to illuminate 
(<span dir="rtl">אור</span>  hiph., Num 8:2; cf. Exod 25:37; Ps 18:29). It is a source of light (cf. <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> <span dir="rtl">אֹור</span>, ‘the light of the lamp’, Jer 25:10) and can be equated with ‘light’ (cf. the 
parallellism <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> | <span dir="rtl">אֹור</span>  [Ps 119:105; Job 29:3; Prov 6:23] and <span dir="rtl">אֹור</span> | <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> [Job 18:6; Prov 13:9]). The lamp is used in houses of man (Job 
18:6; Prov 31:18) and in the dwelling of God, in 
the Tabernacle (Exod 25:37[2x]; 27:20; 30:8; 
35:14; 37:23; 39:37[2x]; 40:4, 25; Lev 24:2, 4; 
Num 4:9; 8:2 [2x], 3;  except Exod 27:20; Lev 
24:2 always used in the plur.), the sanctuary of 
Shiloh (<span dir="rtl">אֱלֹהִים</span> <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span>, 1 Sam 3:3), and in the Temple of Solomon (always in plur., 1 Kgs 7:49; 
1 Chron 28:15 [3x]; 2 Chron 4:20f.; 13:11; 29:7). 
Evidently also in Zech 4:2 (plur. 2x) holy lamps 
are meant.


The lamp is used to dispel the opposite of light 
(2 Sam 22:29; Ps 18:29; Job 18:6; 29:3; Prov 
20:20), the darkness (<span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁךְ</span>) of the night, including the haunting demons. Apotropaic power 
is attributed to the light.  Even in the houses of th poorest a lamp as kept burning at night  (Weippert 2002, 182). The presence of 
lamps in the sanctuary, intended to guarantee that also at 
night the deity would have a pleasant and safe 
abode, betrays a strongly anthropomorphic notion 
of God. The lamp also serves to find one’s way in the 
darkness (Ps 119:105; Job 29:3; Prov 6:23) or 
to look for (<span dir="rtl">חפשׁ</span>  qal or pi.) something or someone in dark or hidden places (Zeph 1:12 [plur.]; 
Prov 20:27; cf. Luke 15:8). To increase the 
effect of the light, the lamp is placed on a stand 
(→ <span dir="rtl">מְנֹרָה</span>). Lamps and stand belong together and are often mentioned together (Exod 25:37; 
37:23; 39:37; 40:4, 24f.; Lev 24:4; Num 8:2f.;1  Kgs 7:49; Zech 4:2; 1 Chron 28:15; 2 Chron 
4:20f.; 13:11). To boost the intensity of the 
light more lamps are used. In Exod 25:37; 37:23; 
Num 8:2; Zech 4:2 the number of seven lamps occurs. With exception of Zech 4:2 (the seven 
lamps had seven spouts [<span dir="rtl">מוּצָקֹות</span>]) no information is given about the lamp’s shape. Because in Exod 
25:37; 37:23 it is not explicitly stated that the 
lights are to be of gold (note also Exod 25:38; 
37:23), it is sometimes assumed that, like common lamps (see section 8), the Tabernacle lamps were of 
ceramic (e.g. Meyers 1976, 57). It has to be 
borne in mind, however, that metal lamps were 
luxury items. Because YHWH’s house is furnished 
like the house of a prince, and because the lamps 
of the Temple of Solomon were made of gold 
(<span dir="rtl">זָהָב</span>; 1 Kgs 7:49; 1 Chron 28:15 [+ <span dir="rtl">כֶּסֶף</span>, ‘silver’]; 2 Chron 4:20f.), it is natural to think 
of lamps of gold. So LXX Exod 38:17. 
The lamp burns oil (<span dir="rtl">הַמָּאֹור</span> <span dir="rtl">שֶׁמֶן</span>, → <span dir="rtl">מָּאֹור</span>) by means of one or more wicks (→ <span dir="rtl">פִּּשְׁתָֹּה</span>). For the care (<span dir="rtl">ערך</span> qal [Exod 27:21; Lev 24:3f.; Ps 132:17; cf. Exod 39:37]) of the lamp, 
the lighting of which is explicitly mentioned (<span dir="rtl">עלה</span>  hiph. in Exod 25:37; 27:20; 30:8; 40:4, 25; Lev 24:2; 
Num 8:2f.; <span dir="rtl">בער</span>  pi. in 2 Chron 4:20; 13:11), various utensils (→ <span dir="rtl">כְּלִי</span>) were available, further particularised as ‘containers and fuels 
of the lampstand’s oil’ (<span dir="rtl">שַׁמְנָהּ</span> <span dir="rtl">כְּלֵי</span>, Num 4:9; cf. Matt 25:3f.), ‘forceps, tongs’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מֶלְקַחַיִם</span>), ‘firepans’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מַחְתָֹּה</span> plur.), ‘trimming knives, snuffers’ (→ <span dir="rtl">מְזַמֶּרֶת</span>).

Spreading of darkness as a result of the 
lamp’s extinguishing (<span dir="rtl">דעך</span> qal [Job 18:5f.; 21:17; Prov 13:9; 20:20; 24:20]; <span dir="rtl">כבה</span>  qal [1 Sam 3:3; Prov 31:18] and pi. [2 Sam 21:17; 2 Chron 29:7]) 
has to be prevented by good care. According to 
Exod 30:7f.; Lev 24:3 (cf. also Num 8:2f.), 
the care for the lights in the Tabernacle was 
entrusted to Aaron, the highpriest. In Exod 
27:21 that task is also assigned to his sons, the 
priests (cf. 2 Chron 13:10f.). 


With regard to the 
time of burning of the lamps in the Tabernacle 
the information is diverse. In Exod 27:20 and 
Lev 24:2 mention is made of permanent light 
(<span dir="rtl">תָֹּמִיד</span> <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span>; for the conspicuous sing. [to be regarded as a collective, cf. Lev 24:4, or as 
the incorporation of an ancient tradition according to 
which originally there stood just one lamp in the 
sanctuary, cf. 1 Sam 3:3] see the discussion in 
Houtman  2000, 462f.). However, 
Exod 27:21; 30:7f.; Lev 24:3 give the 
impression that the light burned only at night, 
from evening till morning (cf. 1 Sam 3:3; 2 Chron 
3:11).  It has been proposed that continuous 
burning was necessary because light from the 
outside could not reach the inner sanctuary. It 
is further contended that in ancient Israel there 
was the custom to have a lamp burning in the 
house day and night. If that were the case, the 
existence of an analogous practice in the 
sanctuary would be quite plausible. It is 
doubtful if such a custom of letting a lamp 
burn continually really existed (see Galling 1923, 33-37). What is 
possible is that people liked to have a lamp 
burning all night. Particularly the well-to-do 
could afford that (Prov 31:18). For the 
sanctuary it was an ordinance to have the lamp 
burning through the whole night. The true meaning 
of Exod 27:20 seems to be that there must always 
be enough oil, so that without interruption, each 
night anew, the light can burn again. Negligence 
brings on the wrath of YHWH (cf. 2 Chron 29:7). It 
must be assumed that, as with regular homes, the 
sanctuary was naturally light enough by day (cf. 
also 1 Kgs 8:12).


The lamp, i.e. the burning lamp, is used as a 
metaphor for the Torah of YHWH (Ps 119:105), and 
for the instruction of the Wisdom teacher (Prov 
6:23). It is a symbol of the social (Jer 25:10; 
cf. 4 Ezra 10:22; Rev 18:23) as well as of the 
individual happiness and prosperity (Ps 18:29; 
Prov 13:19a) which have to be attributed to YHWH’s 
‘lamp’, God’s benevolent and salutary presence (2  Sam 22:29; Job 29:3; cf. the characterisation of 
YHWH as <span dir="rtl">אֹור&thinsp;־יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>  in Isa 10:17, and as <span dir="rtl">וְיִשְׁעִי</span> <span dir="rtl">אֹורִי</span>  in Ps 27:1). Cf. also Prov 31:18, where the lamp has a literal as well as a 
figurative sense (permanent wellbeing). Generally 
the text of Prov 20:27 with the lamp of YHWH 
(<span dir="rtl">יְהוָה</span> <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> ) as a metaphor for ‘the human spirit’ (<span dir="rtl">אָדָם</span> <span dir="rtl">נִשְׁמַת</span>), is considered corrupt (<span dir="rtl">נֹצֵר</span> ‘he who heeds’ instead of <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> is proposed; cf. Job 7:20; Prov 24:12). The lamp also is a symbol of the king as 
the source of blessing for his people, of whom 
the nation’s wellbeing depends (<span dir="rtl">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span> <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span>, of David in 2 Sam 21:17, → beginR<span dir="rtl">נִיר</span>\endR; cf. the characterisation of the king as <span dir="rtl">אַפֵּּינוּ</span> <span dir="rtl">רוּחַ</span>, ‘the breath of our nostrils’ in Lam 4:20), and a designation for the royal descendant on the 
throne who keeps the dynastic light burning (Ps 
132:17; cf. the use of → <span dir="rtl">נִיר</span>). Similarly Babylonian and Assyrian deities and  kings could be designated as the <i>nūru</i> ‘light, lamp’ of world (<i>CAD</i> (N), 347-351). The Old Aramaic light-goddess Aya is called <i>Nr</i> (<i>KAI</i>, Bd. 1, 245).

The lamps of 
Zeph 1:12 may be regarded as a designation of 
the eyes of YHWH (cf. Zech 3:9; 4:10). The 
extinguished lamp is a symbol of the misfortune 
and the end of the wicked (Job 18:6; 21:17; Prov 
13:9b; 20:20: 24:20), who have no descendants and 
no future (cf. also Rev 2:5). In the sanctuary 
the radiant light of the lamps offers a fitting 
environment to him who is all brightness and 
glory (cf. Isa 60:1-3; Hab 3:4, 11; Ps 50:2; 
104:1f. and e.g. 1 Tim 6:16; 1 John 1:5). It is 
assumed that <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> as a personal name (1 Sam 14:50f.; 1 Chron 8:33, etc.) and as an element of a 
personal name, <span dir="rtl">אֲבִינֵר</span> (1 Sam 14:50) or <span dir="rtl">אַבְנֵר</span>,  Abner (‘the father is a lamp’ or ‘Ner is the father’, 1 Sam 14:50f. etc.), and <span dir="rtl">נֵרִיָּהוּ</span>  or <span dir="rtl">נֵרִיָּה</span>, Neriah (‘my lamp is YH, Jer 32:12, 16; 36:14, 32 etc.), is also a 
metaphor of happiness and prosperity (Noth 1928, 
167f.; Fowler 1988, 81). 


Cf. Krauss, <i>TA</i>, Bd. 1, 68-71.
The cultic lamps are dealt with in Judaic 
sources, but their data do not contribute to the 
elucidation of their form and meaning in the 
Hebrew Bible. According to later tradition, also 
during the day a light was burning in the 
sanctuary. Josephus, <i>Ant.</i>, III.199, relates that three of the seven lamps remained 
lit. Rabbinic tradition mentions only one lamp 
that was kept burning and used to light the other 
lamps at night (m.Tamid, III, 10[9]; VI, 1). Complete 
quenching of the lamp was regarded as ominous 
(b.Joma, 39b). It would seem that the later 
practice was influenced by the tradition about 
the tent shrine. The existence of a permanently 
burning light in the second temple is explicitly 
mentioned by Pseudo-Hecataeus (in Josephus, 
<i>Apion</i>, I, 199). Also the synagogue had 
one or two permanent lamps. In 11Q19 (= 11QTemple<sup>a</sup>) <span dir="rtl">נר</span>  plur. occurs in col. IX.12 and XXII.1 (see also 11Q20<sup>b</sup> V.22).

### 6.3 Archaeology

<b>A.1</b> The lamp was invented in prehistoric times (Salonen, <i>Hausgeräte</i>, vol. 1, 131-3). It was a shallow bowl (for the oil), 
sometimes with the rims bent inward and with one 
or more (cf. Zech. 4:2) notches -- the rim pinched 
outward, creating a spout -- for one or more wicks 
(of flax) (→ <span dir="rtl">פִּּשְׁתָֹּה</span>). It is known that from the end of the 7th century in Palestine there was 
in use a closed lamp with two openings, a spout 
for the wick and a shallow cavity with a circular hole  for pouring in the oil. Sometimes the lamps had a small base and 
normally were of pottery, but lamps made of stone 
and metal were in use as well. For descriptions 
and illustrations see Dalman, <i>AuS</i>, Bd. 4, 269-73; Bd. 7, 230-2; <i>BRL</i><sup>2</sup>, 198-201; 
Barrois 1939, 451-453; Smith 1961; 1964; 1966; Kennedy 1963; Israeli & Avida 1988; Weippert 1988, 335f., 
410-2, 640-5; Adler 2004; Sussman 2007.


## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> The lamp was a shallow bowl containing olive- or castor oil, 
sometimes with the rims bent inward and with one 
or more notches for one or more wicks. Usually it 
was of ceramic, but as luxury items also metal 
lamps were in use. Often the lamp denotes the 
burning lamp. In that case <span dir="rtl">נֵר</span> can acquire the meaning ‘light’.
