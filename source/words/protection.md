* Text doubtful: —


<b>B.1</b> Dahmen (2013: 315) assumes the restoration 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ישׁו]עתי אשר תרים למצער</span>
in
1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 14:10-11 (its numbering: ll. 7-8 in the <i>DSS.SE</i> ).<!-- CHECK numbering--> It is not clear how אשר can be
fitted into this restoration: the alternative (in Lohse as well as the
<i>DSS.SE</i>) which restores
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">[כי יד]עתי</span>
is better, understanding אשר
according to its occasional equivalence to כי. In any case the text is
too damaged at this point to play any part in a semantic study.

Qere/Ketiv: none.


## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  See <a href="/sahd/words/to_save%2C_help/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl" lang="he">ישׁע</span>, 1. Root and Comparative Material</a>.


## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b>  The pattern is <i>qatūlat</i> (BL, 471-72), for which there are examples with both stative 
(<span dir="rtl" lang="he">גְּבוּרָה</span>, <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מְלוּכָה</span>) and passiv
(<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שְׁבוּעָה</span>, <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שְׁמוּעָה</span>)
meanings. Other such formations seem to be related to the qal stem,
which is not attested in BH for ישׁע.

<b>A.2</b>  12x in plural in OT (9x Psalms, 2x Isaiah, 1x 2&nbsp;Samuel), 8x in Qum (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small>
19:23; 1QS 1:19; 1QM 4:13; 18:7; 4Q185 2:13; 4Q438 4 ii+5:3; 4Q511 1:5;
10:8).


<b>A.3</b>  Even if gender represents a difference in meaning between יְשׁוּעָה
and יֵשַׁע (see <a href="#6.A.4">Exegesis&nbsp;A.4</a> and <a href="#7.A.4">Conclusion&nbsp;A.4</a>), it still could be
employed for poetical reasons (Watson 1980: 339). Isa 62:1b exhibits what
Watson calls a ‘reversed pattern’, with masc. צֶדֶק corresponding to fem.
יְשׁוּעָה.

## 3. Syntagmatics


<b>A.1</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is the subject of the verbs הָיָה ‘to be’ (Isa 51:6) + לְ (Isa
49:6), יָצָא ‘to go out’ (Isa 62:1), שׂגב piel (Ps 69:30), and עָבַר ‘to
pass over’ (Job 30:15).


<b>A.2</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is the direct object of the verbs רָאָה ‘to see’ (Exod 14:13;
Isa 52:10; Ps 98:3; 2&nbsp;Chron 20:17), עָשָׂה ‘to do’ (1&nbsp;Sam 14:45; Isa 26:18 [of
pl]), גדל hiph ‘to magnify’ (2&nbsp;Sam 22:51=Ps 18:51), שִׁית ‘to set up’ (Isa
26:1), שׁמע hiph ‘to announce’ (Isa 52:7), נָתַן ‘to give’ (Pss 14:7; 53:7
[of pl]), צוה piel ‘to command’ (Ps 44:5), פָּעַל ‘to make’ (Ps 74:12
[of pl]), בשׂר piel ‘to report’ (Ps 96:2; 1&nbsp;Chronron 16:23), and יָדַע hiph ‘to
make known’ (Ps 98:2).


<b>A.3</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is governed by קוה piel + לְ to await’ (Gen 49:18; Isa
59:11), שָׂמַח + בְּ ‘to rejoice in’ (1&nbsp;Sam 2:1; Isa 25:9; Sir 32/35:25),
גִיל + בְּ ‘to rejoice in’ (Pss 9:15; 13:6; 21:2; 4Q511 1:5), רנן piel +
בְּ ‘to shout about’ (Ps 20:6; 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 26:10; 1QS 10:17), שׂוּשׂ + בְּ ‘to
rejoice in’ (Ps 35:9; 1QM 13:13), זמר + בְּ ‘to sing of’ (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small>
19:23), בָּטַח + בְּ ‘to trust in’ (Ps 78:22), הָלַךְ + לְ ‘to come to’
(Ps 80:3), ראה + בְּ ‘to see’ (CD 20:34), ראה hiph + בְּ ‘to cause to
see’ (Ps 91:16), שׂבר piel + לְ ‘to hope for’ (Ps 119:166), תָּאַב + לְ
‘to long for’ (Ps 119:174), and צָפָה + לְ ‘to look for’ (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 6:5).
It is also the indirect object of פאר piel + בְּ ‘to adorn with’ (Ps
149:4).


<b>A.4</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is nomen regens of יהוה ‘Lord’ (Exod 14:13; 2&nbsp;Chronron 20:17),
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">אֱלֹהִים</span> ‘God’ (Isa 52:10; Ps 98:3), יִשְׂרָאֵל ‘Israel’ (Ps 14:7), and of
עולם ‘eternity’ (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 7:19). The plural of יְשׁוּעָה is nomen regens
of מֶלֶךְ ‘king’ (2&nbsp;Sam 22:51), מָשִׁיחַ ‘anointed’ (Ps 28:8 [with <span dir="rtl" lang="he">מָעוֹז</span>]), 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">פנה</span>, ‘face’ (Pss 42:6, 12; 43:5), <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יַעֲקוֹב</span>,  'Jacob' (Ps 44:5), <span dir="rtl" lang="he">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>, ‘Israel’ (Ps 53:7 [contrast Ps 14:7]).


<b>A.5</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is nomen rectum of צוּר ‘rock’ (Deut 32:15; Ps 89:27),
מַעְיָנִים ‘springs’ (Isa 12:3), חֹסֶן ‘treasure’ (Isa 33:6), יוֹם ‘day’
(Isa 49:8), כֹּבַע ‘helmet’ (Isa 59:17), pl ptc אָהַב ‘to love’ (Ps 70:5),
אֱלֹהִים ‘God’ (Ps 88:2), קוֹל ‘sound’ (Ps 118:15), עֹז ‘strength’ (Ps
140:8), אהל ‘tent’ (1QH 20:3; 26:10), עת ‘time’ (1QM 1:5), and תעודות
‘pledges’ (1QM 14:5). The plural of יְשׁוּעָה is nomen rectum of מָעוֹז
‘stronghold’ (Ps 28:8), inf cstr of יָדַע ‘to know’ (Ps 67:3), כּוֹס
‘cup’ (Ps 116:13), אל ‘God’ (1QS 1:19; 1QM 4:13), שׁער ‘gate’ (1QM 18:7),
רוח ‘spirit’ (4Q438 4 ii+5:3), רנה ‘jubilation’ (4Q511 1:5), and כנור
harp’ (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 19:23; 4Q511 10:8). Although יְשׁוּעָה is often used of
God (referred to by a suffix in (e.g.) Isa 51:6; Ps 98:2; at Qumran CD
20:34; 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 6:5; 1QS 10:17; 1QM 13:13; 4Q 185 2:13; 4Q381 15:9; Sir
32/35:25[?]), it is very rarely the nomen rectum of אֱלֹהִים, which is a
significant contrast to יֵשַׁע. In view of the number of occurrences of
יְשׁוּעָה it is surprising how rarely it ever serves as nomen rectum. In
1QS 11:12 the suffix of יְשׁוּעָה refers to the human speaker, and in
4Q503 48-50:6 to Israel.


<b>A.6</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is found in a nominal clause withבְּעֵת צָרָה ‘in the time
of distress’ (Isa 33:2), לַיהוה ‘to the Lord’ (Jon 2:10; Ps 3:9), אֲני ‘I
[= God]’ (Ps 35:3), מִמֶּנּוּ ‘from him’ (Ps 62:2), לִי ‘for me’ (Job
13:16), and לעמו ‘for his [God’s] people’ (4Q491(4QM<small><sup>a</sup></small>) 11 ii 17;
15:7).


<b>A.7</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is the predicate of אֵל ‘God’ (Isa 12:2; Ps 68:20), יהוה
‘Lord’ (Ps 28:8), הוּא ‘He [=God]’ (Ps 62:3, 7), אַתָּה ‘you =[God]’ (Ps
89:27).


<b>A.8</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is modified by the adjectives גָּדוֹל ‘great’ (1&nbsp;Sam 14:45),
קָרוֹב ‘near’ (Isa 56:1).


<b>A.9</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is preceded by the preposition לְ after the verb הָיָה ‘to
be’ (Exod 15:2; 2&nbsp;Sam 10:11; Isa 12:2; Ps 118:14, 21), the particle אֵין
‘not’ (Ps 3:3), רָחוֹק + מִן ‘far from’ (Pss 22:2; 119:155).


<b>A.10</b>  יְשׁוּעָה follows the noun, preceded by <i>waw</i>, צוּר ‘rock’ (Ps 62:3,
7).


<b>A.11</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is in apposition to חוֹמָה ‘wall’ (Isa 60:18), יהוה‘Lord’
(Ps 140:8)


<b>B.1</b>  In the parallel verses 2&nbsp;Sam 22:51 and Ps 18:51 the pl. יְשׁוּעוֹת is
preceded by a word that is read מַגְדִּיל in the K of 2&nbsp;Samuel and in the Q
of Psalm 18, but מִגדּוֹל, ‘tower’ (a unique form of the noun), in the Q of
2&nbsp;Samuel. The K of Psalm 18 could be read either as a defective writing of 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַגְדִּיל</span> or as 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מִגְדֹּל</span> (or indeed 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מִגְדָּל</span>, the normal form). The Versions uniformly presuppose 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַגְדִּיל</span> in both places and Luther and most modern EVV follow suit. But KJV followed the Q in each verse and recently NRSV (but not RSV) has done the same. It seems likely that the
Q readings were used by the Masoretes to indicate the existence of the
variant reading in the parallel text. The variation could have arisen
through confusion of <i>yodh</i> and <i>waw</i> in the consonantal text. But which
reading is to be preferred (if a choice must be made)? God or his name is occasionally described as a 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מִגְדָּל</span> (Ps 61:4; Prov 18:10) and the combination with 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">יְשׁוּעוֹת</span>  makes some sense. The uniqueness of 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מִגדּוֹל</span> might be cited as an argument for its originality, but it could just as
well be the result of a scribal error. In the context 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַגְדִּיל</span> is much
more likely because of the following nomen rectum
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַלְכּוֹ</span>. If 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מִגדּוֹל</span>
were intended one would expect <span dir="rtl" lang="he">לְמַלְכּוֹ</span>. 
Hence this occurrence of 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">יְשׁוּעוֹת</span>
is included above in A.2 rather than A.5.


<b>B.2</b>  In Hab 3:8 the words 
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">מַרְכְּבֹתֶיךָ יְשׁוּעָה</span> could in themselves readily be understood as a nominal clause (cf. LXX, Tg, Vg), meaning 
that Yhwh’s chariots ‘bring victory’, as in the examples in A.6 above
(for the use of an abstract noun as the predicate in a nominal clause
see GK §141c). In the context, however, where the prophet is asking in
effect <i>why</i> Yhwh has appeared in mighty power to do battle, this
would make for a weak climax to the question, even if grammatically the
words might be construed as a circumstantial clause: ‘with your chariots
bringing you victory’. It may be for this reason that Pesh <i>wʿl mrkbtʾ
dpwrqnk</i>, ‘_and</i> on the chariots <i>of your</i> redemption/salvation’,
already made יְשׁוּעָה into an attribute of מַרְכְּבֹתֶיךָ, with some
paraphrase to get round the problem of a nomen rectum following a
suffixed form. As Rudolph (who translates: ‘mit deinen siegreichen
Wagen’ [1975: 231]) points out, GK §131r allows for a noun to be attached
adverbially in ‘apposition in the wider sense’ (cf. Ezek 16:27; 24:13; 2&nbsp;Sam
22:33; Ps 71:7): cf. A.11 above.

<b>A.1</b>  The Versions in general choose the same translation equivalents as
those of the cognate noun יֵשַׁע. What is striking in comparison with
יֵשַׁע is the rarity of translations denoting a ‘saviour’, since the LXX
only gives the rendering σωτήρ on four occasions (Deut. 32:15; Isa 12:2a;
Ps 62[61]:3, 7), Tg פרק part. once (Deut 32:15) and the Vg <i>Iesus</i> once
(Ps 149:4).


<b>B.1</b>  In Jon 2:10 Pesh’s use of <i>pwrʿnʾ</i>, ‘recompense’, which is usually
the equivalent of words like נָקָם and גְּמוּל, is based on its
understanding of the context, not the meaning.


<b>B.2</b>  In Isa 51:8 Vg has <i>iustitia</i> for ישׁועה just after using <i>salus</i> for
צדקה. It is clear that the regular equivalents have been inverted,
following the order of the Heb. words in v. 6.

<b>A.2</b>  With a word which has all but four of its 78 biblical occurrences in
poetry (see below 6. Exegesis A.1) parallelism offers some important
clues to its meaning (with some support from close associations of other
kinds). Surprisingly, there are hardly any matches with the
‘deliverance’ word-group: only with the <i>verb</i> עָזַר in Isa 49:8. The
shortage of frequent nouns from other roots in this group may well have
contributed to this. In any case the parallel or related nouns fall into
a number of other groups: words for success or blessing (רָמָה קֶרֶן
‘horn exalted’ [1&nbsp;Sam 2:1], אוֹר ‘light’ [Isa 49:6], אֹרֶךְ יָמִים ‘length
of days’ [Ps 91:16], בְּרָכָה ‘blessing’ [Ps 3:9], נְדָבָה ‘honour’ [Job
30:15]), words for power (עֹז ‘strength’ [Exod 15:2 par.; Pss 21:2; 28:8;
140:8], זְרוֹעַ ‘arm’ [Isa 33:2: reading זְרֹעֵנוּ with Vss], גְּבוּרָה
‘might’ [Ps 86:3]; 1QS 10:17; 1QM 13:13), relational words (חֶסֶד
‘kindness’ [2&nbsp;Sam 22:51 par.; Pss 13:6; 98:3; 1QS 10:17 (cf. 11:12);
4Q185 2:13], אֱמוּנָה ‘faithfulness’ [Isa 33:6; Ps 98:3]), words for
protection (זִמְרָת ‘protection’ [Exod 15:2 par.]; מָעוֹז ‘refuge’ [Ps
28:8], צוּר ‘rock’ [Pss 62:3; 89:27]), words for praise (תְּהִלָּה
‘praise’ [Ps 62:18], רִנָּה ‘jubilation’ [Ps 118:15]), 
the related words <span dir="rtl" lang="he">צְדָקָה</span>
[Isa 51:6, 8; 56:1; 59:17; Ps 98:2] and
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">צֶדֶק</span> [Ps 62:1] (which
are often thought to mean ‘deliverance’ or ‘vindication’ in such cases)
and occasionally words for justice (מִשְׁפָּט [Isa 59:11]) or revenge
(נָקָם [Isa 59:17]) and the expression שׁוּב שְׁבוּת (Isa 52:7; Ps
14:7=52:7: ‘restoration’?); at Qumran additionally כפר ‘atone’ (CD
20:34); שׁלום עד ‘everlasting peace’ (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 7:19; cf. 1QM 13:13; 4Q503
48-50:6); כבוד ‘glory’ (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 20:3); משענה ‘support’ (1QM 4:13); עזר
and עזרה ‘help’ (1QM 4:13; 13:13); נצח ‘victory’ (1QM 4:13); פלא
‘wonder’ (1QM 18:7); רחמי אל ‘the mercies of God’ (4Q511 10:8); and in
Sir ריב ב[רי] ‘maintain the cause’ (32/35:25).


<b>A.3</b>  Where יְשׁוּעָה is found in parallelism with צְדָקָה and a suffix is
added to the feminine ending (Isa 51:6, 8; 56:1; Ps 98:2), the
association is emphasised by assonance, which in Ps 98:2 becomes
end-rhyme (Watson 1984:229-33). This is a distinct poetic device from
the feature noted in 2. Formal Characteristics A.2.

## 6. Exegesis


<b>A.1</b>  יְשׁוּעָה is found only four times in biblical prose (Exod 14:13; 1&nbsp;Sam
14:45; 2&nbsp;Sam 10:11; 2&nbsp;Chronron 20:17), all in military contexts where ‘victory,
success’ might be appropriate interpretations of the meaning. Most other
occurrences are in Isaiah (19x) or Psalms (45x): no other book has more
than two. By contrast one-third of the (33) occurrences of תְּשׁוּעָה are
in prose.


<b>A.2</b>  The evidence of lexical fields and associations (see above) suggests
that ‘salvation, deliverance’ is not central to the meaning of יְשׁוּעָה.
Various kinds of ‘success’ secured by divine acts of power and
faithfulness can be denoted by the word. An association with moral
factors is important in Isaiah 40-66 and Psalm 98 (which are related in some
way) but not elsewhere.


<b>A.3</b>  In Isa 26:1 יְשׁוּעָה forms part of the picture of a strong, well
defended city with ‘walls and bulwark’ (חוֹמוֹת וָחֵל). The verb יָשִׁית
‘sets up’ might be understood to have God as its subject, but an
indefinite subject equivalent to a passive is perhaps more likely (cf.
Tg, Vg).

<a id="6.A.4"></a>
<b>A.4</b>  That יְשׁוּעָה is used of God’s acts but very rarely of God himself
(in contrast to יֵשַׁע) is an overlooked semantic differentiation. Ben
Asher, for example, sees no semantic differentiation between non-animate
nouns with both masculine and feminine forms (1978:1–14). It is clear,
however, from the Syntagmatics and the Versions how they differ in this
regard. It may be that the shorter form was more adept to this use.


<b>A.5</b>  At Qumran יְשׁוּעָה takes on a strongly eschatological aspect,
especially in CD 20:34, 1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> and of course 1QM. This is also attested
in Sir 32/35:25. In some passages, however, it seems to be used of the
present experience of the righteous whose worship brings them into
fellowship with heavenly beings (1QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 20:3 = 4QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 3:2-3; 26:10 =
4QH<small><sup>a</sup></small> 7 i 14; 4Q511 10:8: cf. Ringgren:127-32; Dahmen, <i>ThWQ</i> 2:312)


<b>B.1</b>  BDB indicate that יְשׁוּעָה is synonymous with תְּשׁוּעָה (447, 448;
cf. Formal Characteristics), but do not speak of its relationship to
יֵשַׁע. This is an over-simplification (see below, 7. Conclusion, A.4,
A.5).

## 7. Conclusion


<b>A.1</b>  Of the three nouns יֵשַׁע, תְּשׁוּעָה and יְשׁוּעָה, יְשׁוּעָה is the
most frequently occurring, although it is only found four times in prose
texts. It is predominantly used in liturgical contexts, being found most
often in Psalms, as well as frequently appearing in Isaiah. It is found
in the plural a few times, which may account for its possible use in
reference to God’s ‘acts’ (see A.4 below).


<b>A.2</b>  יְשׁוּעָה has a stative connotation, perhaps denoting ‘protection’,
which is especially brought out by Isa 26:1 where יְשׁוּעָה is set up like
walls and ramparts. Verbs of motion are rare with יְשׁוּעָה (Syntagmatics
A.1) and it is much more common with verbs of feeling (Syntagmatics
A.3), speaking or seeing (Syntagmatics A.2). Verbs of positioning are
also found (Syntagmatics A.2) in contexts of battle.


<b>A.3</b>  It is the nomen rectum of nouns denoting, amongst other things,
power or protection (Syntagmatics A.5) and this is similar to the
meaning of יֵשַׁע, although יְשׁוּעָה is not found so often with this
sense.

<a id="7.A.4"></a>
<b>A.4</b>  The distinction between the masculine noun יֵשַׁע and the feminine
יְשׁוּעָה is seen in part to be merely that of poetic variation.
Synonymous parallelism has a preference for matching nouns of the same
ending, or for opposing them for contrast (Watson 1980). It seems clear,
however, from the Syntagmatics and the Versions how יֵשַׁע and יְשׁוּעָה
differ in use. יֵשַׁע often appears as the nomen rectum of ‘God’, to
indicate that God is the speaker’s יֵשַׁע, whilst יְשׁוּעָה is found used
more of God’s acts. It may be that the shorter form was more adept to
this use, involving as it did the addition of a pronominal suffix. יֵשַׁע
also appears to be used frequently as nomen rectum of nouns denoting
defence or strength.


<b>A.5</b>  Although יְשׁוּעָה may have the meaning ‘help’ (cf. Vg), this is rare
in comparison to the use of תְּשׁוּעָה.
