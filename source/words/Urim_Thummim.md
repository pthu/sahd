### Text Doubtful

<b>A.1</b>
<span id="IntroA1">In SP, Exod 28:30 </span>
begins with a phrase that is not found in MT:
<span dir="rtl">ועשית את הארים ואת התמים</span>,
‘and you will make the Urim and the Thummim’. 
The plus of SP is clearly secondary. 
The following phrase in SP corresponds with Exod 28:30 in MT:
<span dir="rtl">ונתתה על חשן המשפט את הארים ואת התמים</span>.
SP recounts the execution of the instruction in an additional phrase after Exod 39:21:
<span dir="rtl">ויעשו את הארים ואת התמים כאשר צוה יהוה את משה</span>,
‘and they made the Urim and the Thummim, as YHWH had commanded Moses’.
Virtually the same reading is partially preserved in 4QExod-Lev<sup><small>f</small></sup>: 
<span dir="rtl">ויעש את האורים ו[את התמים...]</span>, 
‘and <i>he</i> made the Urim and [the Thummim …]’.
Since 4QExod-Lev<sup><small>f</small></sup> dates form the mid-third century BCE, this plus shows a very early tendency to harmonise passages and to fill gaps (Hendel 2016:177-78, 241-42). 

<span id="1S14v41lxx"> <b>A.2</b></span>
The Hebrew and Greek texts of 1 Sam 14:41 differ 
considerably. MT reads as follows:

<div style="padding-left: 22px; padding-right: 44px; text-align: right; text-indent: 22px;">
<span dir="rtl"> 
 וַיֹּ֣אמֶר שָׁא֗וּל אֶל־יְהוָ֛ה אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל הָ֣בָה תָמִ֑ים וַיִּלָּכֵ֧ד יוֹנָתָ֛ן וְשָׁא֖וּל וְהָעָ֥ם יָצָֽאוּ׃
</span> 
</div>

<div style="padding-left: 44px; padding-right: 44px; text-indent: 0px;">
And Saul said to YHWH, ‘God of Israel, give <i>perfection</i>.’ 
And Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the people were cleared.
</div>

The expression <span dir="rtl">הָבָה תָמִים</span> may here mean ‘give a clear answer’.[^1] The consonantal text of MT is presupposed in Pesh, Vg and Tg<sup><small>J</small></sup>. In LXX, however, the text of the verse is more extensive, with a Latin translation of the text of LXX being transmitted in the Vetus Latina (VL) and part of the manuscripts of the Vulgate (Vg); see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>.
LXX has the following text in 1 Sam 14:41:

<div style="padding-left: 44px; padding-right: 44px; text-indent: 0px;">
καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ τί ὅτι οὐκ ἀπεκρίθης τῷ δούλῳ σου σήμερον εἰ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἢ ἐν Ιωναθαν τῷ υἱῷ μου ἡ ἀδικία κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ δὸς δήλους καὶ ἐὰν τάδε εἴπῃς ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου Ισραηλ δὸς δὴ ὁσιότητα καὶ κληροῦται Ιωναθαν καὶ Σαουλ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ἐξῆλθεν. 
</div>

<div style="padding-left: 44px; padding-right: 44px; text-indent: 0px;">
And Saoul said, “O Lord God of Israel, why is it that you have not answered your slave today? If this guilt is in me or in my son Ionathan, O Lord God of Israel, give <i>clear ones</i>, and if this is what you say, ‘In your people Israel,’ give, now, <i>holiness</i>.’’ 
And Ionathan and Saoul were indicated by the lot, and the people were cleared. (NETS)
</div>

In several other instances, the plural of Greek δῆλος, ‘clear one’, represents Hebrew <span dir="rtl">אורים</span> (see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>). 
This raises the question of whether the Greek text was based on a different version of the Hebrew text including the word <span dir="rtl">אורים</span>.
The word <span dir="rtl">תמים</span> is represented by ὁσιότητα, ‘holiness’, and seems to have been interpreted as an occurrence of the noun <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>. If the Greek text was based on a Hebrew text, this Hebrew text can be reconstructed as follows (cf. 14:39):[^2]

<div style="padding-left: 22px; padding-right: 44px; text-align: right; text-indent: 22px;">
<span dir="rtl" lang="he">למה לא ענית את עבדך היום אם בי או ביונתן בני העון הזה יהוה אלהי ישראל הבה אורים ואם ישנו(?) בעמך ישראל הבה תמים
</span>
</div>

<div style="padding-left: 44px; padding-right: 44px; text-indent: 0px;">
‘Why have you not answered your servant today?
If this guilt is in me or in my son Jonathan, O YHWH God of Israel, give Urim, but if it is in your people Israel, give Thummim.’ 
</div>

Many scholars regard the shorter reading of MT as the result of <i>parablepsis</i>, due to the twofold occurrence of the word <span dir="rtl">ישראל</span>,
which led to the omission of the text between <span dir="rtl">אל יהוה אלהי ישראל</span> 
and <span dir="rtl">ישראל הבה תמים</span> and the skipping of one of the occurrences of <span dir="rtl">ישראל</span>.[^3] 
Other scholars, however, still defend the priority of MT.[^4] It seems best to take both options into account.[^5] Actually, even if the more extensive reading of LXX is secondary, it may still be relevant for the interpretation of the Urim and Thummim (see <a href="#Exe">Exegesis</a>).

 <b>A.3</b> 
The Urim and the Thummim are attested in 4Q164 and 11Q19 (see <a href="#Exe">Exegesis</a>), but their occurrence is less certain in other, more fragmentary non-biblical texts from Qumran. For the quotation of Deut 33:8 in 4Q175 (4QTest), see the discussion of Deut 33:8 under <a href="#Exe">Exegesis</a>. 

<b>A.4</b>
According to Eliezer Sukenik’s early analyses, the Thanksgiving scroll (<i>Hodayot</i>, 1QHod<sup><small>a</small></sup>) contains three occurrences of the word <span dir="rtl">אורתום</span>, 
with one of the occurrences partially restored.[^6]
The meaning of <span dir="rtl">אורתום</span> is uncertain, but already in his Hebrew <i>editio princeps</i>
Sukenik suggested that it is the singular of <span dir="rtl">אורים ותמים</span>, 
‘Urim and Thummim’.[^7]
Sukenik’s interpretation was taken over by Dupont-Sommer (1952:74), who translated <span dir="rtl">אורתום</span> 
as ‘Destiny’.
Others, however, regard
<span dir="rtl">אורתום</span> as a compound noun consisting of the elements
<span dir="rtl">אוֹר</span>, ‘light’, 
and <span dir="rtl">תֹּום</span>, ‘perfection’: 
‘light of perfection’, or ‘perfect light’.[^8]
According to some more recent editions,
the text reads <span dir="rtl">אורתים</span>, not <span dir="rtl">אורתום</span>,
which renders a connection with the Urim and Thummim even less likely.
In DJD 
and the SBL edition of 1QHod<sup><small>a</small></sup>, 
<span dir="rtl">אורתים</span> is interpreted as the dual of <span dir="rtl">אוֹרָה</span> and translated as ‘early light’.[^9] 

<b>B.1</b>
The proposal to emend the consonantal text of Hos 3:4 and 4:5 and to read forms of <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">תְּרָפִים</span> (3:4) and <span dir="rtl">אִמֶּךָ</span> (4:5)[^10] is not supported by the oldest textual witnesses.
Furthermore, there is no reason to change the vocalisation of <span dir="rtl">תָּמִים</span> 
in Amos 5:10 into <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>.[^11] 
It has been proposed to replace the vocalisation 
of the enigmatic form <span dir="rtl">תּוֹמִיךְ</span> 
(<i>hiph.</i> of unknown verb <span dir="rtl">ימך</span>?) in Ps 16:5 by <span dir="rtl">תּוּמֶיךָ</span>:
<span dir="rtl">תּוּמֶיךָ גּוֹרָלִי</span>, ‘Your Thummim are my lot’.[^12] However, it is more convincing to interpret the form as part. m.sg. of <span dir="rtl">תמך</span>, ‘to take hold of’:
<span dir="rtl">אַתָּה תּוֹמֵ(י)ךְ גּוֹרָלִי</span>,
‘you hold my lot’.[^13]

##<span id="RCM">1. Root and Comparative Material</span>

<b>A.1</b> 
<span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> is traditionally derived 
from √<span dir="rtl">אור</span>, ‘to be(come) light’,
just like the nouns 
<span dir="rtl">אוּר</span>, ‘fire’,
and
<span dir="rtl">אוֹר</span>, ‘light’,[^14]
although it is possible to interpret <span dir="rtl">אור</span> as 
a denominative verb derived from <span dir="rtl">אוֹר</span>.[^15] 
Part of the earliest translations already express a connection of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> with
the verb <span dir="rtl">אור</span> or the nouns <span dir="rtl">אוֹר</span> and <span dir="rtl">אוּר</span> 
(see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>). 
The connection with the verb <span dir="rtl">אור</span> is explicit in the Talmud, which 
uses the verb <span dir="rtl">אור</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to enlighten’, to explain the meaning of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span>:
<span dir="rtl">למה נקרא שמן אורים ותומים אורים שמאירין את דבריהן</span>, 
‘why is their name called Urim and Thummim? 
Urim, because they enlighten their words’ 
(bYoma 73b); 
<span dir="rtl">ולמה נקרא שמם אורים שהן מאירין לישראל</span>, ‘and why is their name called Urim? Because they enlighten for Israel’
(yYoma 7, 44c). 
An addition in Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (Tg<sup><small>PsJ</small></sup>) Exod 28:30 explains the function of the Urim and Thummim in a similar way, using the Aram. verb <span dir="rtl">נהר</span> <i>pael</i>, ‘to illumine’: 
<span dir="rtl">אוריא דמנהרין מיליהון ומפרסמין טמירן דבית ישראל</span>,
‘the Urim, which 
illumine their words and uncover 
the secrets 
of the house of Israel’.
A phrase in 4Q164 (4QpIsa<sup><small>d</small></sup> fr1:5) may already
reflect the same derivation:
<span dir="rtl">מאירים כמשפט האורים והתומים</span>,
‘those who enlighten according to the judgment of the
Urim and the Thummim’. 

<span id="ARR"><b>A.2</b></span>
Julius Wellhausen proposed to derive <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> from 
√<span dir="rtl">ארר</span>, ‘to accurse’ (Wellhausen 1883:418-19 n. 1; cf. Van Dam 1997:95 n. 55). In the same context, he suggested that <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> designates the contrasting aspect of the pair and connected this word with Arabic 
<i>tamīma</i>, ‘amulet’ (see B.1 below). The derivation of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> from √<span dir="rtl">ארר</span> is mentioned in several dictionaries[^16] and is preferred in <i>DCH</i> viii, with <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> translated as ‘acquitted’.[^17] For the form, see <a href="#FC">Formal Characteristics</a>.

<span id="YRH"><b>A.3</b></span> With reference 
to Grimme (1901), GB, 318, mentions <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> in connection with the verbs 
<span dir="rtl">ירה</span> I <i>qal</i>/<i>hiph.</i>, ‘to throw’, and <span dir="rtl">ירה</span> III <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to instruct’.

<b>A.4</b> Hans Duhm (1926:50) interpreted <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> as an ancient pass. part. form of <span dir="rtl">ארה</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to pluck’:
He supposed that the term <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> denoted plucked off twigs that jumped out of the priest’s pouch. The derivation from <span dir="rtl">ארה</span> is mentioned as one of the options in KBL.[^18] 

<span id="TMM"><b>A.5</b></span> <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> is usually interpreted as the plural form of the noun <span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span>, ‘completion’, ‘perfection’ (cf. <a href="#FC">Formal Characteristics</a>). Like the adjectives <span dir="rtl">תָּם</span> and <span dir="rtl">תָּמִים</span> (‘perfect’, ‘blameless’), 
the noun <span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span> is a derivative of √<span dir="rtl">תמם</span>, ‘to be(come) complete’. 
The interpretation of <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> 
as the plural of <span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span> is found in most of the dictionaries,[^19] but <i>HALOT</i> 
mentions as a second option that <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> can be regarded as ‘an independent tantum pl.’.[^20] <i>DCH</i> refers to the option of translating <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> by ‘acquitted’
(also derived from the verb <span dir="rtl">תמם</span>), which becomes attractive if <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> 
is translated as ‘accursed’ (see A.2).[^21]
Part of the earliest translations already express a connection of <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> with 
the verb <span dir="rtl">תמם</span> and its derivatives
(see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>). 
This connection is already made explicit in the Talmud,
where the question
<span dir="rtl">למה נקרא שמן אורים ותומים</span>,
‘why is their name called Urim and Thummim?’,
is followed by an answer that uses the verb <span dir="rtl">שלם</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to fulfill’, 
to explain the term Thummim: 
<span dir="rtl">תומים שמשלימין את דבריהן</span>,
‘Thummim, because they fulfill their words’ (bYoma 73b). An addition in Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (Tg<sup><small>PsJ</small></sup>) Exod 28:30 offers a similar explanation: <span dir="rtl">תומיא דמשלימין בעובדיהון לכהנא רבא</span>,
‘the Thummim, which bring fulfillment in their affairs for the high priest’. 
In the Jerusalem Talmud, the name Thummim is explained
with the verb <span dir="rtl">תמם</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to complete, make perfect’:
<span dir="rtl">ותומים שהן מתימין לפניהם את הדרך שבשעה שהיו ישראל תמימין היו מכוונין להן את הדרך</span>,
‘and Thummim, because they make perfect the road
before them; as long as Israel was perfect, they were straightening 
the road for them’
(yYoma 7, 44c). 
Although many dictionaries propose to derive <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> from <span dir="rtl">תמם</span>,
this derivation remains uncertain (cf. BDB, 1070). 
 
<b>A.6</b>
Werner Dommershausen considered the etymology of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> as uncertain: 
‘The words “Urim” and “Thummim” cannot be explained etymologically from the Hebrew vocabulary. Israel took them over from foreign people 
dwelling in the land of Canaan, but we do not know the language from which they were taken’ (Dommershausen 1977:453).

<b>B.1</b> 
A connection of <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> with Arabic <i>tamāim</i>, ‘amulets’ 
(sg.: <i>tamīma</i>), was proposed by Freytag 
(1830:199).
Initially, Julius Wellhausen approved the proposal (1883:418-19 n. 1; 
cf. A.2 above), but later he began to cast doubt on it 
(Wellhausen 1897:143-44, 166). 
More recently, the connection with the Arabic word was rejected quite emphatically by Van Dam
(1997:96 n. 63).

<b>B.2</b>
There have been several unconvincing proposals to derive <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> from Akkadian and Egyptian roots
(Van Dam 1997:95-97).


##<span id="FC">2. Formal Characteristics</span>

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">אוּר</span>, ‘fire’, is interpreted as a <i>qul</i> form (BL, 452, §61r). The related noun <span dir="rtl">אוֹר</span>, ‘light’ (plural <span dir="rtl">אוֹרִים</span>, see Ps 136:7), may originally be just a variant form of <span dir="rtl">אוּר</span>, ‘fire’ (BL, 452, §61s), if it is not a <i>qull</i> form, like <span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span> (BL, 455, §61f ʹ, with reference to Akkadian
<i>urru</i>, ‘day’).  Although <span dir="rtl">אֻרִים</span> in Isa 24:15 is interpreted as the plural of <span dir="rtl">אוּר</span>, ‘fire’,
it is uncertain whether <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> is the plural of this noun. See <a href="#RCM">Root and Comparative Material A.1</a>.

<b>A.2</b>
If <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> is a derivative of the verb <span dir="rtl">ארר</span>, ‘to accurse’ (see <a href="#ARR">Root and Comparative Material, A.2</a>),
the form may belong to the same category as 
<span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span> (< <span dir="rtl">תמם</span>, plural <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>), 
<span dir="rtl">רֹב</span> (< <span dir="rtl">רבב</span>, plural \*<span dir="rtl">רֻבִּים</span>)
and <span dir="rtl">עֹז</span> (<&nbsp;<span dir="rtl">עזז</span>, plural \*<span dir="rtl">עֻזִּים</span>).[^22]

<b>A.3</b>
<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> is often interpreted as the plural of <span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span>, ‘completion, perfection’ (see <a href="#TMM">Root and Comparative Material A.5</a>).
No other occurrences of the plural of <span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span> are attested. <span dir="rtl">תֹּם</span> (<&nbsp;\*<i>tumm</i>)
is a <i>qull/qutl</i> form derived from the verb <span dir="rtl">תמם</span> (BL, 455, §61hʹ).
The vowel <i>u</i> 
and the doubling of the <i>mem</i> 
are preserved before 
suffixes (<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּי</span>, <span dir="rtl">תֻּמּוֹ</span>, <span dir="rtl">תֻּמָּם</span>, etc.).
Nouns of the <i>qull/qutl</i> 
type are ‘often used to form abstract forms’.[^23] 


##<span id="Syn">3. Syntagmatics</span>

<b>A.1</b> In Biblical Hebrew, <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are mostly determinate, 
with either a suffixed possessive pronoun (Deut 33:8) or the article (Exod 28:30; Lev 8:8; Num 27:21; 
cf. vocalisation
<span dir="rtl">בָּאוּרִים</span> MT 
1 Sam 28:6;
also 4Q164 fr1:5; 11Q19 lviii:18-21). 
The use of the article in Exod 28:30 is quite remarkable, since the <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> 
 had not been mentioned previously.
Also in the additional phrase of
SP before Exod 28:30 MT, <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are determinate:
<span dir="rtl">ועשית את הארים ואת התמים</span>,
‘and you will make <i>the</i> 
Urim and <i>the</i> 
Thummim’. 
In Neh 7:65 there is no article before <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>. MT’s vocalisation 
of the preposition preceding <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> in Neh 7:65 
and <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> 
in Ezra 2:63
(<span dir="rtl">לְ</span>) also 
implies the absence of the article. 
In the Mishnah, the article is omitted before both nouns
(mYoma 7:5, mSoṭah 9:12, 
mShevuʿot 2:2). 
For 1 Sam 14:41, see <a href="#1S14v41lxx">Introduction A.2</a>.

<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are never specified by adjectives. 
The nouns occur only in the absolute state.

<b>A.3</b> <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> occur as <i>nomina recta</i> 
of 
<span dir="rtl">מִשְׁפָּט</span>, ‘judgment’, ‘decision’, in Num 27:21 (<span dir="rtl">וְשָׁאַל לוֹ בְּמִשְׁפַּט הָאוּרִים</span>), 
11Q19 lviii:18-19 (<span dir="rtl">ושאל לו במשפט האורים והתומים</span>), 
4Q164 (4QpIsa<sup><small>d</small></sup>) fr1:5 (<span dir="rtl">מאירים כמשפט האורים והתומים</span>).

<b>A.4</b> <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> occur in the nominal clause
<span dir="rtl">תֻּמֶּיךָ וְאוּרֶיךָ לְאִישׁ חֲסִידֶךָ</span>, ‘Your Thummim and Your Urim (belong) to Your faithful one’ (MT Deut 33:8).

<b>A.5</b> 
<span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are the subject of the verb 
<span dir="rtl">היה</span> qal, ‘to be’, 
in Exod 28:30. 
<span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are the direct object of the following verbs:

* <span dir="rtl">נתן</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to give’, Exod 28:30, Lev 8:8. 
* <span dir="rtl">עשׂה</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to make’, Exod 28:30 (SP), 39:21 (4QExod-Lev<sup><small>f</small></sup>, SP); cf. <a href="#IntroA1">Introduction A.1</a>.
* <span dir="rtl">יהב</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to give’, 1 Sam 14:41 (source text of LXX? cf. <a href="#1S14v41lxx">Introduction A.2</a>);
Deut 33:8 in 4Q175 (see <a href="#Exe">Exegesis</a>). 

<b>A.6</b> <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are governed by <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> in
Ezra 2:63/Neh 7:65. 
<span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> is governed by a <span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> indicating the instrument in 1 Sam 28:6 (+ <span dir="rtl">ענה</span>, ‘to answer’).

<b>A.2</b>
Some renderings in the older layers of LXX seem to be based on guesses prompted by the context,
such as δήλωσις and δῆλος pl. as translations of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span>, but 
especially ἀλήθεια as translation of <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>,
although these renderings may reflect an early interpretation of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> as a derivative of <span dir="rtl">ירה</span> hiph., ‘to instruct’
(cf. διδαχή Deut 33:8<sup><small>σʹ</small></sup> and <a href="#YRH">Root and Comparative Material A.3</a>), and of <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> as a derivative of <span dir="rtl">אמן</span> (Houtman 2000:494). 
These Greek renderings have influenced later translations; see especially

(<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>).
Furthermore, the renderings σ´ διδαχή, ‘teaching’,
Pesh ܝܕܥܬܐ, ‘knowledge’, and Vg 
<i>doctrina</i>, ‘instruction’, may also have been influenced by LXX’s translation of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> by δήλωσις and δῆλος pl.
Other renderings in Pesh and Vg may also have been prompted by the context; e.g., Pesh ܫܐܠܬܐ, ‘request’, ‘inquiry’, Vg <i>doctus</i>, <i>eruditus</i>.

<b>A.3</b> Especially the somewhat more recent translations of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span>

harmonises the expression with the following <span dir="rtl">גַּם בַּנְּבִיאִם</span>, ‘nor by the prophets’, rendered 
in Vg as <i>neque per prophetas</i>. The free translation of <span dir="rtl">גַּם בָּאוּרִים</span> 
took the connection of the Urim with the priesthood elsewhere in the Hebrew 
Bible into account.

<b>A.5</b>
In Ezra 2:63 and Neh 7:65, the <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>

Pesh Ezra 2:63; Neh 7:65: ܟܗܢܐ ܪܒܐ ܘܢܫܐܠ ܘܢܚܙܐ, ‘a high priest who can ask and can see’;

##<span id="LSF">5. Lexical/Semantic Fields</span>


<b>A.1</b>
The Urim and the Thummim belong to the semantic field 
of ‘divination’. The noun <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גּוֹרָל</span>, ‘lot’, belongs to the same semantic field; cf. also <span dir="rtl" lang="he">פּוּר</span> (Esth 3:7; 9:24). Lots were also kept in a container before they were cast (Dommershausen 1977:450). Unlike the <span dir="rtl" lang="he">גּוֹרָל</span>, however, the Urim and Thummim relate to the inquiring of God with regard to decisions that must be made. Ada Taggar-Cohen (2002:102) rightly observes:

> Some scholars have interpreted the <i>ʾûrîm wǝtūmmîm</i> as a lot oracle. However, the casting of lots in the ANE is different from other methods of divination, since it was not used for telling the future, or for making a decision such as whether a king should go out to war; clearly it was not an oracular practice. 



##<span id="Exe">6. Exegesis</span>

###<span id="Exe-lit">6.1 Biblical Evidence</span>

<b>A.1</b>
In Exod 28:30, Moses receives the instruction to put 
(<span dir="rtl">נתן</span>) the Urim and the Thummim (<span dir="rtl">אֶת הָאוּרִים וְאֶת הַתֻּמִּים</span>) into the ‘breastpiece of 
decision’ (<span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן הַמִּשְׁפָּט</span>).
This indicates that the Urim and the Thummim were supposed to be tangible objects.
The instruction with regard to the making of the <span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן</span>, ‘breastpiece’,
had been given in 28:4, 25-29, where <span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן</span> already occurs twice as the <i>nomen regens</i>
of <span dir="rtl">מִשְׁפָּט</span> (28:15: <span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן מִשְׁפָּט</span>;
28:29: <span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן הַמִּשְׁפָּט</span>). 
The <span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן</span> is described as a square pouch: <span dir="rtl">זֶרֶת אָרְכּוֹ וְזֶרֶת רָחְבּוֹ</span>,
‘a span its length and a span its width’ (28:16). Since a <span dir="rtl">זֶרֶת</span>, ‘span’,
is at most 25 cm, the Urim and Thummim are supposed to have been quite small.
Remarkably, MT does not indicate that the Urim and Thummim had to be made. The impression that they existed already is 
strengthened by the use of the article: <span dir="rtl">הָאוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">הַתֻּמִּים</span> (contrast 28:4: 
<span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן</span>, ‘breastpiece’,
<span dir="rtl">אֵפֹד</span>, ‘ephod’, etc.).
The instruction to make the Urim and Thummim in SP is clearly secondary (<a href="#IntroA1">Introduction A.1</a>).
Since the breastpiece had to be attached over the <span dir="rtl">אֵפֹד</span>, ‘ephod’,
the Urim and Thummim would be on the heart of Aaron (<span dir="rtl">עַל־לֵב אַהֲרֹן</span>, 28:30).
The end of 28:30 indicates a strong relationship between the Urim and Thummim and <span dir="rtl">מִשְׁפָּט</span>, ‘decision’, ‘judgment’:
The presence of the Urim and Thummim on Aaron’s heart 
when he will come before YHWH (<span dir="rtl">לִפְנֵי יְהוָה</span>) 
implies that ‘Aaron will carry (<span dir="rtl">נשׂא</span>) the <span dir="rtl">מִשְׁפָּט</span> 
of the Israelites on his heart (<span dir="rtl">עַל לִבּוֹ</span>) before YHWH (<span dir="rtl">לִפְנֵי יְהוָה</span>)’. 
The instruction is carried out in Lev 8:8:
As Aaron is consecrated to be priest of YHWH, 
Moses clothes him (<span dir="rtl">שׂים עָלָיו</span>) with the breastpiece 
(<span dir="rtl">הַחֹשֶׁן</span>) and puts (<span dir="rtl">נתן</span>) the Urim and the Thummim into 
the breastpiece.
The repetition of the object marker <span dir="rtl">את</span> in 
the expression <span dir="rtl">אֶת הָאוּרִים וְאֶת הַתֻּמִּים</span> (Exod 28:30; Lev 8:8)
seems to indicate that the words <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> 
designate two different objects or two distinct groups of objects. 
See also the plural form <span dir="rtl">וְהָיוּ</span>, ‘and <i>they</i> 
will be’, which follows in Exod 28:30.

<b>A.2</b>
Num 27:15-23 recounts the appointment of Joshua as Moses’ successor.
According to Num 27:21, God tells Moses that in the future Joshua must stand before Eleazar the 
priest, who is Aaron’s son and successor. 
On behalf of him (apparently Joshua), he (apparently Eleazar) shall consult the 
judgment of the Urim (<span dir="rtl">וְשָׁאַל לוֹ בְּמִשְׁפַּט הָאוּרִים</span>) before YHWH (<span dir="rtl">לִפְנֵי יְהוָה</span>).
It is the judgment of the Urim that indicates what the Israelites, under the leadership Joshua, must do (27:21b):
<span dir="rtl">עַל פִּיו יֵצְאוּ וְעַל פִּיו יָבֹאוּ הוּא וְכָל בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אִתּוֹ וְכָל הָעֵדָה</span>,
‘at its word they shall go out, and at its word they shall come in, he, and all the children of Israel with him, all the congregation’.
The suffix <span dir="rtl">ו</span>– at the end of the expression <span dir="rtl">עַל פִּיו</span> 
probably refers back to <span dir="rtl">מִשְׁפַּט הָאוּרִים</span>, ‘judgment of the Urim’; 
cf. <span dir="rtl">עַל פִּי הַגּוֹרָל</span>, ‘according to the lot’, in Num 26:56;
<span dir="rtl">על פי המשפט</span>, ‘according to the judgment’ in 11Q19 lviii:21. 
In Num 27:21, the Urim may be mentioned as a <i>pars pro toto</i> 
for the Urim and the Thummim (cf. 11Q19 lviii:18-21). 
The decisions of the Urim may concern Joshua’s leadership in general (see 27:16-17),
but according to many scholars they relate, more specifically, to warfare; 
cf. <span dir="rtl">יצא</span>/<span dir="rtl">בוא</span> in 27:21b and
in Josh 14:11; 1 Sam 18:13, 16; 29:6. 

<b>A.3</b>
In Deut 33:8 Moses blesses Levi, the tribe of priests. According to MT he 
addresses God as follows:
<span dir="rtl">וּלְלֵוִי אָמַר תֻּמֶּיךָ וְאוּרֶיךָ לְאִישׁ חֲסִידֶךָ</span>, 
‘And about 
Levi he said: “Your Thummim and Your Urim (belong) to Your faithful one”.’
It is significant that the Thummim and Urim are described as originating with God: ‘<i>Your</i> 
Thummim and <i>Your</i> 
Urim’. 
 The exceptionality of the order with the Thummim mentioned before the Urim
seems to have induced LXX to represent 
<span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> (δήλους)
before <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> 
(ἀλήθειαν); see <a href="#AV">Ancient Versions</a>.
The text of the quotation in 4Q175 (4QTest) 
is more extensive than the text of MT:
<span dir="rtl">וללוי אמר הבו ללוי תמיך ואורך לאיש חסידך</span>,
‘And about 
Levi he said: “<i>Give to Levi</i> 
your Thummim, and your 
Urim to your loyal one”.’

<b>A.4</b>
For 1 Sam 14:41, see <a href="#1S14v41lxx">Introduction A.2</a>. 

<b>A.5</b>
When Saul sees the Philistine army approaching, he consults YHWH (1 Sam 28:6, 
<span dir="rtl">שׁאל ביהוה</span>), but YHWH does not answer him 
(<span dir="rtl">וְלֹא עָנָהוּ יְהוָה</span>), neither through dreams 
(<span dir="rtl">גַּם בַּחֲלֹמוֹת</span>), nor through the Urim (<span dir="rtl">גַּם בָּאוּרִים</span>), 
nor through the prophets (<span dir="rtl">גַּם בַּנְּבִיאִם</span>).
As in Num 27:21, the Urim may be mentioned as a <i>pars pro toto</i> 
for the Urim and the Thummim. 

<b>A.6</b>
According to Ezra 2:63 and Neh 7:65, the governor 
said to the descendants of priestly families who 
were unable to produce their genealogical 
register that they should not eat (<span dir="rtl">אכל</span>) of the 
most holy things (<span dir="rtl">מִקֹּדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים</span>) until a 
priest (<span dir="rtl">כֹּהֵן</span>, Neh 7:65: <span dir="rtl">הַכֹּהֵן</span>)
would arise (<span dir="rtl">עמד</span>)
‘for the Urim and Thummim’
(Ezra 2:63: <span dir="rtl">לְאוּרִים וּלְתֻמִּים</span>;
Neh 7:65: <span dir="rtl">לְאוּרִים וְתוּמִּים</span>). 
The omission of the preposition <span dir="rtl">לְ</span> before <span dir="rtl">תּוּמִּים</span> 
in Neh 7:65 implies a strong relationship between <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> 
and <span dir="rtl">תּוּמִּים</span>, 
but does not imply that the combination <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> 
and <span dir="rtl">תּוּמִּים</span> refers to a single object; 
cf. 2 Chron 9:22 (<span dir="rtl">לְעֹשֶׁר וְחָכְמָה</span>, ‘for wealth and wisdom’;
cf. 1 Kgs 10:23: <span dir="rtl">לְעֹשֶׁר וּלְחָכְמָה</span>);
2 Chron 16:11 (<span dir="rtl">לִיהוּדָה וְיִשְׂרָאֵל</span>, ‘for Judah and Israel’); 
Ezra 1:5 (<span dir="rtl">לִיהוּדָה וּבִנְיָמִן</span>, ‘for Judah and Benjamin’). 

<b>A.7</b>
Many exegetes[^61] 
suppose that in some texts the expression 
<span dir="rtl">באלהים</span> /<span dir="rtl">שׁאל ביהוה</span>, ‘to inquire of God/YHWH’,
implies a role for the Urim and the Thummim, also if they are not mentioned explicitly. 
In addition to 1&nbsp;Sam 28:6 (see A.5), the expression occurs in
Judg 1:1; 18:5; 20:18, 23, 27; 1&nbsp;Sam 10:22; 
14:37; 22:10, 13, 15; 23:2, 4; 
30:8; 2&nbsp;Sam 2:1; 5:19, 23; 1&nbsp;Chron 14:10, 14. 
One of the 
passages—1&nbsp;Sam 30:7-8—refers to the use of an <span dir="rtl">אֵפֹד</span>, ‘ephod’, brought by the priest Abiathar, 
in the divination procedure. This may be significant in view of the notion that Aaron’s breastpiece (<span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן</span>) with the Urim and the Thummim 
was attached to his <span dir="rtl">אֵפֹד</span>, ‘ephod’ (Exod 28:15-30; see A.1). 
It is indeed possible that the reference to the ephod in 1 Sam 30:7-8 implies a role for the Urim and the Thummim, 
although this ephod may be not be similar to the ephod described in Exodus 28 (cf. 1&nbsp;Sam 21:10).
From a methodological point of view, it is questionable whether 
the function of the Urim and the Thummim can be described on the basis of texts in which they are not mentioned explicitly. 
It may be significant that 1&nbsp;Sam 23:6-12, where the ephod brought by Abiathar has a similar role, is preceded by a passage in which David was able to consult YHWH (<span dir="rtl">שׁאל ביהוה</span>, 
23:2, 4), although apparently the ephod was not yet present.
Furthermore, 1&nbsp;Sam 28:6 mentions the Urim explicitly in connection with the expression <span dir="rtl">שׁאל ביהוה</span> (see A.5),
but the text refers to dreams and prophets as alternative channels of divination.
This evidence suggests that it was possible to inquire of God either with or without the Urim and the Thummim, and either with or without the ephod,
and either with or without a role for the priests.



###<span id="Exe-Qum">6.2 Non-Biblical Dead Sea Scrolls</span>

<b>A.1</b>
The Urim and Thummim are attested in at least two non-biblical texts from Qumran.
Fragment&nbsp;1 of 4Q164 (4QpIsa<sup><small>d</small></sup>) preserves part of a <i>pesher</i> 
on Isa 54:11-12, a passage in which several kinds of 
gems are mentioned, 4Q164 fr1:5: […] 
<span dir="rtl">מאירים כמשפט האורים והתומים</span>, 
‘… those who give light according to the judgment of the
Urim and the Thummim’.
This phrase may reflect the interpretation of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> as a derivative of 
√<span dir="rtl">אור</span>, ‘to be(come) light’; see <a href="#RCM">Root and Comparative Material</a>.

<b>A.2</b>
The section of the Temple Scroll (11Q19 = 11QTemple<sup><small>a</small></sup>)
designated as the Law of the King (lvi:12-lix:21)
dates from the second half of the 2nd century BCE.
It is based on Deut 17:14-20 and other biblical passages.

###<span id="Exe-ANET">6.3 Ancient Near Eastern Parallels</span>

During the past decades, the biblical Urim and Thummim have been compared with objects that played a role in Mesopotamian (A.1; cf. A.2) and Hittite (A.3)
divination rituals.

<b>A.1</b>
The most usual form of divination in Mesopotamia was extispicy, 
the meticulous inspection of the entrails of a sacrificial animal
(see, e.g., Starr 1990), 
but the 7th-century Assyrian text of the tablet <i>LKA</i> 
137 (Ebeling 1953:186-87) 
seems to attests the practice of psephomancy, divination with the help of pebbles that could be performed rather quickly.
The colophon at the bottom of the reverse side indicates that the text was copied from an older source text
(Akkadian colophon text: Arbøll 2020:313). 
Unfortunately, several lines of the text are quite damaged, 
especially on the reverse side,
but it is beyond doubt that the text concerns divination with the help of stones with different colours.
Edward Lipiński (1970) already argued that <i>LKA</i> 
137 
‘confirms the opinion that the ʾ<i>ūrīm</i> 
and <i>tummīm</i> 
of the Bible were originally
two stones and gave a “yes” or “no” answer’ (1970:496).
Wayne Horowitz and Victor Hurowitz (1992) translated the Assyrian text and 
discerned many parallels between <i>LKA</i> 
137 and the biblical references to the Urim and Thummim,
but their interpretation was heavily criticised by Irving Finkel (1995), who offered a new translation of the Assyrian text and concluded ‘that LKA 137 can have nothing to do with
either Urim or Thummim’ (1995:276).
Hurowitz adopted part of Finkel’s interpretations and published a new translation of the text including the colophon in <i>COS</i> 1:444-45 (1.127). 


<i>LKA</i> 
137 begins with an invocation of the sun god Šamaš (obv. lines 1-28), 
which includes the wish that this deity will reveal his <i>bīru</i>, ‘inspection’,
and that the Babylonian god Bel/Marduk will reveal his <i>dīnu</i>, ‘decision’
(cf. BHeb. <span dir="rtl">מִשְׁפָּט</span> in 
Exod 28:15, 29, 30;
Num 27:21; 
Prov 16:33). 
Furthermore, this section stipulates that seven 
deities—apparently either their symbols or their 
names—must be drawn on the ground: Sin, Šamaš, Adad, Marduk, Urašgubba, Dagan and Nabium/Nabu (lines 16-18).
Thereafter, the speaker indicates that he has finished the drawing and that he lifts up one or more stones 
(line 19: <i>anašši</i> 
<small>N</small>[<small>A</small><sub>4</sub>.<small>MEŠ</small>]). 
The following section, which concerns a favourable decision, includes the phrase
‘let a stone-of-desire jump up’ (line 23: <small>NA</small><sub>4</sub> <i>erēši lišḫiṭamma</i>),
while the final section of the invocation concerns an unfavourable decision
and includes the phrase 
‘let a stone-of-no-desire jump up’ (line 27: <small>NA</small><sub>4</sub> <i>lā erēši lišḫiṭamma</i>).
Line 28 indicates that the procedure must be repeated up to three times: 
‘Twice for a decision (<i>dīnu</i>), thrice for a verdict (<small>EŠ</small>.[<small>BAR</small>] = <i>purussû</i>).’
The front of the tablet ends with a 
short rubric (line 29): ‘Incantation for a verdict (<small>EŠ.BAR</small>/<i>purussû</i>)
through alabaster and hematite.’
The stones mentioned in this rubric were probably selected because of their different colours: 
the colour of alabaster is close to white, while the colour of hematite is usually close to black, 
although it may range to brown and red.[^62]
The damaged top of the reverse side of the tablet probably refers once again to the drawing of the seven gods on the ground and mentions 
white stones (<small>NA</small><sub>4</sub> 
<small>BABBAR.MEŠ</small>) and 
black stones ([<small>NA</small><sub>4</sub>] <small>GI</small><sub>6</sub><small>.MEŠ</small>). 
What follows is a diagram comprising seven fields, each with the name of one of the seven gods mentioned on the obverse side, 
although some of these names have not been preserved entirely or have not survived at all due to the damage. 
The diagram is assumed to indicate how the drawing on the ground must be performed. <br>
Horowitz and Hurowitz (1992:109-10) pointed to a correspondence between <i>LKA</i> 
137 and the text of 1 Sam 14:41 in LXX: 
<i>LKA</i> 
137 demands that a ‘stone-of-desire’ may jump up in the case of a favourable decision and that a ‘stone-of-no-desire’ 
may jump up in the case of an unfavourable decision (obv. 20-27). 
The Greek text of 1 Sam 14:41 demands δῆλοι, ‘clear ones’, in 
the case of one of the two alternatives, and ὁσιότης, ‘holiness’, in the case of the other (see <a href="#1S14v41lxx">Introduction A.2</a>). 
Horowitz and Hurowitz connected the presumably alabaster ‘stone-of-desire’ with the Urim and the presumably hematite ‘stone-of-no-desire’ with the Thummim,
arguing that alabaster—just like the Urim—expressed the notion of ‘shining’, while they suggested that hematite was
associated with ‘truth’—just like the Thummim
(1992:111-13). They made the following concluding observation (1992:114):

<div style="padding-left: 44px; padding-right: 22px; text-indent: 0px;">
If our analysis of <i>LKA</i> 
137 and Urim and Thummim is accurate, we may cautiously come to the conclusion that the Urim and Thummim
of ancient Israel, even if not entirely identical to the psephomancy stones described in <i>LKA</i> 
137 are highly similar and perhaps somehow related.
</div>

In <i>LKA</i> 
137 the speaker refers to the purity of ‘the hem of my garment’ (<small>TÚG.SÍG</small>-<i>ia</i>; obv. lines 14-15). 
Horowitz and Hurowitz suggested that this hem ‘serves as a container in which the divinatory stones are housed or out of which they are drawn’ 
(1992:103)
and that the biblical <span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן הַמִּשְׁפָּט</span> (Exod 28) and <span dir="rtl">חֵיק</span> (Prov 16:33) had the same function as this hem
(1992:103, 109).
According to Finkel, this suggestion is quite dubious. He argued that the drawing on the ground played a more significant role
than Horowitz and Hurowitz assumed (1995:274-75): 
Stones with different colours were probably thrown on the drawing and the oracular decision was presumably derived from the 
positions where the stones came to rest (Finkel 1995:275-76; similarly Steinert 2018:258).
Apparently, the stones were cast up to three times,
with the result regarded as valid if each of the three attempts had the same outcome,
whereas the procedure was regarded as inconclusive if the outcomes differed from each other
(Finkel 1995:276; cf. Horowitz & Hurowitz 1992:105, 108).
It is unclear how precisely the oracular decision was derived from the distribution of the stones over the drawing on the ground, but it stands to reason that 
bright stones indicated a favourable answer and that dark stones indicated an unfavourable answer (Finkel 1995:276; Lambert 2007:20).
Despite Finkel’s criticism of the interpretation of <i>LKA</i> 
137 by Horowitz and Hurowitz, 
he still designates the diviner to which this text refers as ‘psephomancer’ 
(1995:275-76), which implies that there remain some relevant correspondences between this text and the biblical descriptions of the Urim and Thummim.
Both <i>LKA</i> 
137 and the biblical Urim and Thummim texts refer to divination rituals in which small objects played a decisive role.

<b>A.2</b> 
A Late Babylonian <i>tamītu</i> text from Nippur (CBS 12578) describes divination through the use of two balls of wool. The Babylonian <i>tamītu</i> texts concern oracular consultation of the sun god Šamaš and the storm god Adad, who are addressed as <sup><small>d</small></sup><i>šamaš bēl dīnim</i>, ‘Šamaš, lord of <i>dīnu</i>’, and <sup><small>d</small></sup><i>adad bēl bīri</i>, ‘Adad, lord of <i>bīru</i>’ (Lambert 2007:100–01). As in <i>LKA</i> 137 (above A.1), <i>dīnu</i> here designates the divine decision transmitted by the oracle, while <i>bīru</i>, ‘inspection’, denotes extispicy, the inspection of the entrails of an animal (Lambert 2007:5). In CBS 12578 Šamaš and Adad are asked to reveal whether a sick person will recover. The following passage discloses part of the procedure 
(lines 9-12): 

> The ball of white wool (<i>piqqanni šīpāti peṣâti</i>) 
in front of the ball of red wool (<i>piqqanni nabāsi</i>) from salt water which I have placed before your great divinity, [may they] be noted so that I may witness your reliable decision.[^63]

According to Lambert (2007:19-20), the colour symbolism is comparable to that of <i>LKA</i> 
137 (above A.1), with 
the white ball representing a positive answer to the diviner’s question and the red ball representing a negative answer:

> The diviners regularly ask for a “yes” answer, so the sequence of the balls, white before red, was a visual hint. Perhaps the two balls were then put in a bag or other 
container, where shaken up, and somehow one came out first and its colour provided the answer.[^64]

<span id="KIN"><b>A.3</b></span>
Anne Marie Kitz (1997)
argued that the Hittite KIN oracles are important for the interpretation of the Urim and Thummim. 
However, her interpretation of the Hittite texts is somewhat outdated in view
of the more recent analyses. 
Several scholarly studies describe
the basic structure of the KIN oracles.[^65] 
In Hittite literature dated between the late 14th and late 13th centuries, the KIN (literally: ‘work’) is considered to be one of the means through which the gods
revealed their will. Many KIN oracles concern a decision that the questioner had to take,
for instance the king in the case of warfare.
After the question, which is so phrased that the answer can be either ‘yes’ or ‘no’,
the text expresses the wish for either a positive answer (‘Let the KIN be favourable’),
or a negative answer (‘Let the KIN be unfavourable’).
The following section relates to the ritual itself, performed by an ‘Old Woman’. In general, the ritual
led to a clear answer, 
either ‘favourable’, 
or ‘unfavourable’. 
According to the texts, the standard ritual implied that a symbol ‘took’ other symbols and ‘gave’ them to yet another symbol,
or put them into the latter symbol or at a specific position near it.
Apparently, certain combinations of symbols were interpreted as ‘favourable’ or ‘unfavourable’,
with some of the individual symbols having either a positive or a negative connotation. 
As the outcome of the ritual was often not immediately clear, the procedure was usually repeated once or twice.
The following example of a standard oracular report concerns the king’s plan to wage war. 
The king hopes that the ritual will affirm his plan and he receives a positive response (<i>KUB</i> 
5.1 ii:60-65):

> … Let (the oracle) be favorable. ‘Ḫannaḫanna’ arose and took ‘well-being’, ‘the good of the land’ and ‘ZABABA’.
They are placed to the right of ‘the Hittites’. Second: ‘The Hittites’ took for themselves ‘rightness’, ‘power’ and strength’, ‘the royal campaign’ and ‘well-being’.
To ‘the gods’. Third: ‘The enemy’ took for himself ‘battle’, and ‘the whole soul’. They were given back to ‘the enemy’. Favorable.[^66] 



Only in a small number of reports, no outcome of the procedure is mentioned, even though the ritual was performed three times.
Some of the sections describing such an unresolved oracular quest end in an extensive unwritten space, perhaps to make a later addition of the outcome possible 
(Orlamünde 2001:301 n. 42; Warbinek 2019b:143-47).
Unfortunately, we can no longer retrieve how the ritual was performed. In a thorough study of one of the KIN texts (<i>KUB</i> 
5.1 + 52.65),
Julia Orlamünde hints at the possibility that 
a kind of pawns with symbolic values 
provided the crucial information while moving over an oracular gameboard. 
She argues that cup-marked stones and rocks excavated in the Hittite capital Hattuša, especially in cultic areas, 
may have functioned as such KIN boards, casting doubt on the older assumption that the function of the artificial cavities was to
contain food and libation offerings (Orlamünde 2001:310-11). 
According to Livio Warbinek (2019a:162-63), Orlamünde’s hypothesis is supported by other ancient Mediterranean evidence, 
including the biblical Urim and Thummim.
Further, Warbinek (2019a) points out that the KIN procedure was easily performed,
which was a significant advantage when the questioner was in haste. 
The other Hittite divination methods, such as augury (interpretation of the behaviour of birds) and extispicy (interpretation of animal entrails),
took more time and were usually more expensive (see already Orlamünde 2001:311).


###<span id="Archaeol">6.4 Archaeology</span>


<b>A.1</b>
Excavations in the southern Levant (Megiddo, Tell eṣ-Ṣafi/Gath, Tel Abel Beth Maacah, etc.)
have uncovered some large hoards of astragali, worked bones of mainly sheep and goats, which date from Late Bronze Age or Iron Age contexts.
Most of the astragali show traces of artificial abrasion, which has made them more cube shaped and allows them to be used as dice.
Many of them have drill holes, some of which have been filled with metal to make them heavier.
Most of the hoards have been found in cultic contexts, sometimes in an open or closed vessel.
The conclusion was drawn that such astragali were cast or drawn in the context of divination rituals (Susnow et al. 2021).

###<span id="Real Plurals?">6.5 Plural Forms</span>

<b>A.1</b>
The plural forms <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and 
<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> have been explained in different ways (cf. Kitz 1997:401-02): 

1. <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are true 
plurals, with each of these terms referring to more than one object
(e.g., Noort 1977:93-94; also Robertson 
1964: twenty-two objects, each with a letter of the alphabet).
2. Originally, <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and 
<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are singulars with mimation that were later erroneously interpreted and vocalised as 
plurals (Jirku 1953; for mimation, see Waltke & O’Connor, <i>IBHS</i>, §9.8). 
Several scholars assume that each of the terms 
<span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> designates a single object, namely either a white or a black stone
(e.g., Lipiński 1970; Dommershausen 1977:453). Note that the ancient versions have both singular and plural renderings of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> as well as <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>.
3. <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and 
<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> 
are <i>plurales intensivi</i> 
and together constitute a hendiadys designating a single object, possibly a gem 
(Van Dam 1997:161, 224, 230;
Houtman 1990:230; 2000:496 with n. 343). 
4. According to Anne Marie Kitz (1997),
<span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and 
<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> are real plurals, with the plural forms not 
primarily indicating multiple objects, but rather the repetition of the casting of the objects, 
as we know it from the Assyrian text <i>LKA</i> 
137 and the Hittite KIN oracles 
(see <a href="#Exe-ANET">Ancient Near Eastern Parallels</a> A.1 and A.3).

<b>A.2</b> In view of the evidence described earlier, the interpretation of <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים וְתֻמִּים</span> as a hendiadys (option 3) seems to be less convincing.
The plural form <span dir="rtl">וְהָיוּ</span> in Exod 28:30 and the 
repetition of the object marker <span dir="rtl">את</span> before <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> in 
Exod 28:30 and Lev 8:8
seem to indicate that the words <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span> and <span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span> 
designate two different objects or two distinct groups of objects (see <a href="#Exe-lit">Biblical Evidence, A.1</a>). 
Although this is not decisive, the text of 1 Sam 14:41 in LXX also suggests that the terms Urim and Thummim refer to two different objects or two groups of objects
(<a href="#1S14v41lxx">Introduction A.2</a>). 
Furthermore, it is harder to imagine that the outcome of the oracular quest remained unclear (see 1 Sam 28:6) if a single object was involved,
while it is understandable that the use of more objects could produce an inconclusive result;
cf. <a href="#KIN">Ancient Near Eastern Parallels A.3</a>.
If only two objects were involved, the outcome of the procedure could be unclear if the ritual was repeated and the consecutive results differed from each other; 
cf. <a href="#Exe-ANET">Ancient Near Eastern Parallels A.1</a>.


##<span id="Con">7. Conclusions</span>

<b>A.1</b> The etymology of the words <span dir="rtl">אוּרִים</span>, ‘Urim’, and 
<span dir="rtl">תֻּמִּים</span>, ‘Thummim’, is uncertain. The traditional derivation from √אור, ‘to be(come) light’, and from √תמם, ‘to be(come) complete’, respectively, is one of the options. 
Although the Hebrew Bible includes several references to the Urim and Thummim, 
their physical nature—including their number, shape and colours—also remains unknown. 
The manner in which they were operated can neither be retrieved with any precision. 

<b>A.2</b> The Urim and Thummim must have been two or more small objects that played a crucial role in a legitimate oracular procedure that
aimed at determining the will of God. The objects were entrusted to the high priest, who carried them in a 
square pouch (<span dir="rtl">חֹשֶׁן</span>). The high priest drew or cast
the Urim and Thummim at least once when the king or another important figure wanted to know the will of God.

<b>A.3</b>
In view of the extra-biblical material, part of 
which came to light only recently, it seems 
legitimate to conceive the Urim and the Thummim as 
differently shaped or differently coloured stones or astragali.

<b>A.4</b>
Biblical evidence (Ezra 2:63; Neh 7:65) and post-biblical evidence 
(4Q164; 11Q19)
indicates that even in a relatively late period
divination with the Urim and the Thummim was not regarded as obsolete and 
that the Urim and the Thummim were still held in high esteem.
