## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> 
<span dir="rtl">לָבָן</span> stands for a colour low in chromaticity, but strong in brightness. Its semantic range encompasses colours from 
‘light grey’ to 
‘light yellow’.
<span dir="rtl">לָבָן</span> describes the colour of human hair and teeth, clothing, linen, female sheep, horses, markings on sheep and goats, seeds, and skin recently healed from an infection. It also describes dust and peeled branches bleached by the sun. Its focal colour is
‘bright white’ in the picture of teeth being 
‘whiter’ than milk (Gen 49:12). It also describes snow as blinding (Sir 43:18<sup><small>B,Mas</small></sup>).
