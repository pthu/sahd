### Text doubtful:

<span id="TDA1"><b>A.1</b></span>
  There is much disagreement over the text and meaning of  <span dir="rtl">פְדֻת</span> in Exod 8:19, rendered  <span dir="rtl">פורקן</span> by Tg<small><sup>O</sup></small> and Tg<small><sup>N</sup></small>. It is listed in BDB under the root  <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (BDB, 804a), although it recognises that the text is dubious, for it is difficult to make sense of this particular verse if one translates it as ‘liberation’. The previous verse contains the vb <span dir="rtl">פלה</span> (<i>hiph</i>.) which means ‘to set apart’ (BDB, 811b) and the idea of separation would make sense in v. 19 also, which is the sense given by LXX’s διαστολή, Pesh’s 
<span dir="rtl">ܦܘܪܫܢܐ</span> (<i>pwršnʾ </i>) and Vg’s <i>divisio</i>. However, Andrew Macintosh argued that ‘there is no evidence in Hebr. for a semantic development [in <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>] from breaking, separation to redemption’ (Macintosh 1971:554; <i>contra</i> Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 1091-92; Muntinghe 1775). The text here may therefore be corrupt, and emendation to <span dir="rtl">פלת</span>, ‘separation’ (root <span dir="rtl">פלה</span> <i>hiph</i>.) was proposed by August Dillmann (1881:80; cf. <i>BHK</i>), although this noun is not attested elsewhere in MT. Graham Davies (1974) suggested instead <span dir="rtl">פ(ר)דת</span> with haplography accounting for the absence of the <span dir="rtl">ר</span>, from the
root <span dir="rtl">פרד</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘to separate’. Alternatively, <span dir="rtl">פדת</span> here may be derived from a different root. Macintosh (1971:551) suggests the root <span dir="rtl">פדד</span>, ‘was alone, separated’ (which corresponds to the cognate in Arabic <i>fadda</i> and in Syriac <i>pad</i>), by analogy with other double-‘ayin verbs and their cognate nouns. Medieval commentators have also tried to account for the unsuitability of <span dir="rtl">פדת</span> in MT. The Rabbinic commentators on Exod 8:19 clearly wanted to maintain the meaning of redemption within the idea of separation: ‘He sent his people deliverance and distinction moreover; that is to say, he distinguished between them and their oppressors’ (R. Jonah ibn Janah (10th century), <i>Sepher Haschoraschim</i>: Bacher
1896:395). There is perhaps an argument, then, for a semantic development of <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> analogous to that of <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> (cf. Ps 136:24; Lam 5:8 in BH and on these passages the SAHD entry <a href="/sahd/words/to_pull_away/"><span dir="rtl">פָּרַק</span></a>: the salvific sense is not limited to or necessarily dependent upon Aram., <i>contra</i> Macintosh 1971:554-55), with an older sense of ‘separation’ attested here in Exod 8:19.

<b>A.2</b>  In 1QM 17:6, a promise of God’s help, <span dir="rtl">[פ]ד֯ותו</span> is read as <span dir="rtl">[ב]ר֯יתו</span> in <i>DSS.SE</i> (140): ‘And he will send everlasting help to the lot of his redemption/covenant’. Either reading would fit the context here, although the argument for <span dir="rtl">פדותו</span> appears to be slightly stronger, supported by the association elsewhere of <span dir="rtl">פדות</span> with <span dir="rtl">גורל</span> (1QM 15:1), of <span dir="rtl">עזר</span> with <span dir="rtl">פדות</span> (4Q491 11ii14) and the frequency of the construct relationship <span dir="rtl">עם פדות</span>, ‘people of redemption’ (1QM 1:12; 1QM 14:5, 4Q266 11:13, 4Q269 16:11).

<b>A.3</b>  In 4Q269 16:11 only <span dir="rtl">ת֯כה</span>[ remains, but the context seems to be a copy of the same passage of the Damascus Document as 4Q266 11:13, so the restoration <span dir="rtl">[פדו]ת֯כה</span> is highly probable.

<b>A.4</b>  The text of 4Q365 6aii+6c:6 from the Reworked Pentateuch is unclear:
<span dir="rtl">וׄרוממנה למרומם[ פ]ד֯ות נתת</span>. But the context (an expansion of the Song of Miriam in Exod 15:21) makes the restoration very appropriate.

<b>A.5</b> In 4Q468y 1:4 (an unidentified fragment) the reading <span dir="rtl">]פ̊דו[ת ]</span> is somewhat uncertain, and the lack of significant context deprives it of any use for semantic analysis.

<b>B.1</b>  It has been suggested (e.g. in <i>BHS</i>) that <span dir="rtl">פדות</span> in Isa 50:2 should be
read as the inf.cstr. of the verb <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> (cf. the verbal renderings in LXX, Tg and Vg), but the abstract noun can bear an equivalent sense and does
not need to be emended.

Qere/Ketiv: none.

<b>A.1</b> See 
<a href="/sahd/words/to_liberate/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פדה</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>.

## 2. Formal Characteristics

<b>A.1</b> Afformative <span dir="rtl">וּת</span>–: Joüon and Muraoka, <i>GBH</i>, §88Mj. <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is always in the singular in both the HB and Qumran, except for 4Q446 3:2, if the reading  <span dir="rtl">פדותיך</span> is correct and the <i>yodh</i> really does indicate that the noun is plural (for cases where it does not, see Reymond 2014:156).


## 3. Syntagmatics

<b>A.1</b> <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is the object of the verb <span dir="rtl">שׂום</span>, ‘to put’ (Exod 8:19), <span dir="rtl">שׁלח</span>, ‘to send’ (Ps 111:9, ind.obj. <span dir="rtl">עַמּוֹ</span>, ‘his people’), and probably  <span dir="rtl">נתן</span>, ‘to give’ (4Q365 6aii+6c 6), all with YHWH as the subject.

<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is the nomen regens of <span dir="rtl">אל</span>, ‘God’ (1QM 1:12a), and <span dir="rtl">עולמים</span>, ‘eternity’ (1QM 1:12b; 15:1; 18:11).

<b>A.3</b> <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is the nomen rectum of <span dir="rtl">עַם</span>, ‘people’ (1 QM 1:12a; 14:5; 4Q266 11:13), <span dir="rtl">אביון</span> pl., ‘poor (ones)’ (1QM 11:9; 4Q446 1:5), <span dir="rtl">נפשׁ</span>, ‘life/soul’ (1QM 14:10), <span dir="rtl">גורל</span>, ‘lot’ (1QM 17:6), <span dir="rtl">עזר</span>, ‘help’ (4Q491 11 ii:14), <span dir="rtl">עשי אלהי</span>[<span dir="rtl">מ</span>, ‘God’s deeds’ (4Q511 63-64 ii:1).

<b>A.4</b> <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> has 1 sg. sf. with human antecedent (4Q511 63-64 ii 1); 2 masc.sg. sf. referring to YHWH (1QM 11:9; 14:10 [=4Q491 8-10 i:8]; 4Q266 11:13 [=4Q269 16:11?], 4Q446 3:2), 3 masc.sg. sf. referring to YHWH (1QM 14:5; 17:6; 4Q446 1:5; 4Q491 11 ii:14), 1 pl. sf. (worshippers: 4Q503 1-6 iii 8).

<b>A.5</b>  <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> occurs with the prepositions:  

* <span dir="rtl">בין</span>, ‘between’ (x2) followed by <span dir="rtl">עמי</span>, ‘my people’, and  <span dir="rtl">עמך</span>, ‘your people’ (Exod 8:19);  
* <span dir="rtl">מִן</span>, ‘from’ (privative) lit. ‘is my hand shortened from redemption?’ (Isa 50:2); 
* <span dir="rtl">עִם</span>, ‘with’ + 3ms sf. ‘him’ (God: Ps 130:7); 
* <span dir="rtl">ב</span>, ‘in’ (1QM 15:1; 18:11).

<b>A.6</b> <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> occurs in nominal clauses: <span dir="rtl">וְהַרְבֵּה עִמּוֹ פְדוּת</span>, ‘great
is redemption with him [God]’ (Ps 130:7); <span dir="rtl">וגורל אל בפדות עולמים</span>, ‘and
the lot of God is in eternal redemption’ (1QM 15:1).

<b>A.7</b> <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is closely associated with <span dir="rtl">יד</span>, ‘hand’, + 1 sg. sf. referring to YHWH (Isa 50:2).

The syntagmatic information suggests that the emphasis of <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is on the power or action of redemption/to redeem, and it is always used in relation to God.

## 4. Ancient Versions

<b>a. Septuaging (LXX)</b>:

* διαστολή, ‘separation’: Exod 8:19;
* λύτρωσις, ‘act of redemption’: Pss 111:9; 130:7;
* ῥύομαι, ‘to rescue’: Isa 50:2.

<b>b. Peshitta (Pesh)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">ܦܘܪܫܢܐ</span> (<i>pwršnʾ </i>), ‘severing, separation’: Exod 8:19;
* <span dir="rtl">ܦܘܪܩܢܐ</span> (<i>purqānā</i>), salvation, redemption’: Ps 111:9; 130:7;
* <span dir="rtl">ܦܕܕ</span> (<i>pdd</i>) <i>peal</i>, to wander away’: Isa 50:2.

<b>c. Targum (Tg: O/N/PsJ/J/K)</b>:

* <span dir="rtl">פורקנא</span>, ‘salvation, redemption’: Exod 8:19<small><sup>O,N,PsJ</sup></small>;
Pss 111:9<small><sup>K</sup></small>; 
130:7<small><sup>K</sup></small>;
* <span dir="rtl">פרק</span>, ‘to redeem’: Isa 50:2<small><sup>J</sup></small>.

<b>d. Vulgate (Vg)</b>:

* <i>divisio</i>, ‘division, separation’: Exod 8:19;
* <i>redemptio</i>, ‘redemption’: Ps 111:9; 130:7;
* <i>redimo</i>, ‘to redeem’: Isa 50:2.

<b>B.1</b>  The divergent renderings by words meaning ‘distinction, division’ in Exod 8:19 in LXX, Pesh and Vg raise the question whether the word in the text there is really  <span dir="rtl">פְדוּת</span>, ‘redemption’ (see <a href="#TDA1">Text Doubtful A.1</a>).

<b>B.2</b> The aberrant rendering of <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> by the similar Syriac verb with a
quite different meaning (‘to miss, fail’) in Isa 50:2 was probably due to the misreading of the previous phrase as a reference to harvest, through a confusion of two homonyms <span dir="rtl">קצר</span>. Syr. <span dir="rtl">ܦܕܕ</span> (<i>pdd</i>) is found elsewhere with <span dir="rtl">ܐܝܕܐ</span> (<i>ʾydʾ </i>), ‘hand’, subject, and Pesh’s rendering could be read interrogatively (cf. Jer 8:19).

## 5. Lexical/Semantic Fields

<b>A.1</b> See <a href="/sahd/words/to_liberate/#5-lexicalsemantic-fields"><span dir="rtl">פדה</span>: Lexical/Semantic Fields</a>.

<b>A.2</b>  In passages related to <span dir="rtl">ושמתי פדות</span> in Exod 8:19, <span dir="rtl">פלה</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘make a distinction’, is used at the corresponding points (8:18; 9:4; 11:7).

<b>A.3</b>  In Isa 50:2 <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i>, ‘deliver’, occurs in parallelism with  <span dir="rtl">פדות</span>; compare the association of the verb <span dir="rtl">פדה</span> with <span dir="rtl">נצל</span> <i>hiph.</i> and other members
of the ‘deliverance’ lexical field.

<b>A.4</b>  In Ps 111:9 the parallel to <span dir="rtl">שלח פדות</span> is <span dir="rtl">צוה לעולם בריתו</span>, and in Ps 130:7 the parallel to <span dir="rtl">פדות</span> is <span dir="rtl">חסד</span>.  <span dir="rtl">ברית</span> and <span dir="rtl">חסד</span> are also closely associated with <span dir="rtl">פדות</span> in 1QM 14:5. These associations indicate the relational and emotional context in which ‘redemption’ of God’s people (cf. <span dir="rtl">לעמו</span> in Ps 111:9 and the construct pairs noted under 
<a href="#SynA3">Syntagmatics A.3</a>) is expected to occur. Similar implications follow from the interchange
between <span dir="rtl">פדותכה</span> (in the sense of ‘redeemed people’) in 1QM 14:10 and, 
<span dir="rtl">כול דורותינו … לשאר̊[ית עמכה]</span> (line 9) and <span dir="rtl">עם קודשכה</span> (line 12) in the neighbouring context, where the terms <span dir="rtl">ברית</span> (ll.8,10) and <span dir="rtl">חסד</span> (l.9) again occur and there is an explicit opposition to the <span dir="rtl">ממשלת בליעל</span> (cf. l.9), as there is to the <span dir="rtl">גוי רשעה</span> in 1QM 15:1(-2) and to the 
<span dir="rtl">מ[מש]ל[ת א]ויב</span> in 18:11. God’s relationship to those he redeems is also implied by the association of <span dir="rtl">פדותו</span> with <span dir="rtl">נאמן</span> in 4Q491 11 ii:14.

<b>A.5</b>  In 1QM 1:12 <span dir="rtl">לפדות עולמים</span> is in apposition to <span dir="rtl">תום</span>, ‘end’, with 3 fem.sg. sf. referring to <span dir="rtl">צרה</span>, ‘distress’, marking the ‘redemption’ as a deliverance from the coming eschatological woes (cf. 15:1).

<b>A.6</b>  In 1QM 11:9  <span dir="rtl">פדות</span> is associated with <span dir="rtl">יד</span>, ‘hand/power’, and with <span dir="rtl">שלום</span>, ‘peace/prosperity’, <span dir="rtl">גבורת פלא</span>, ‘wonderful might’, and <span dir="rtl">תקוה</span>, ‘hope’; in 14:5 with <span dir="rtl">ישועה</span>; and in 17:6 with <span dir="rtl">עזר</span>, ‘help’ and  <span dir="rtl">גבורה</span>, ‘might’; and in 18:11 with  <span dir="rtl">יד גבורתכה</span>, ‘your mighty hand’. In 4Q365 6aii+6c:6 
<span dir="rtl">למרומם [פ]ד̊ות נתת[…]</span> occurs in an expansion of the Song of Miriam celebrating the Exodus and is associated with <span dir="rtl">מרומם</span> and  <span dir="rtl">עשה גאות</span>.

<b>A.7</b>  In 4Q266 11:13 <span dir="rtl">עם פדותך</span> is paralleled by the figurative expression <span dir="rtl">צון מרעיתךה</span> [sic], ‘the flock of your pasture’, which is based on a
metaphor which occurs in Pss 79:13 and 100:3 in close association with <span dir="rtl">עמך</span>/<span dir="rtl">עמו</span>, ‘your/his people’.


<b>A.8</b>  In the hymnic context of 4Q503 1-6 iii:8  <span dir="rtl">פדותנו</span> is associated with
<span dir="rtl">בראשית</span>, ‘in the beginning (of?)’, but the continuation is broken off. It seems unlikely to be eschatological, despite the possible occurrence of <span dir="rtl">עולם</span> just before.

## 6. Exegesis


<b>A.1</b>  The noun <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> seems to be quite distinct from <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּיִם</span>/<span dir="rtl">פִּדְיוֹן</span> and always refers to God’s action or power to act. <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> is
described as being <i>with</i> (<span dir="rtl">עם</span>) God (Ps 130:7) and it is something which
God can send (<span dir="rtl">שלח</span>) to his people, referring to the Exodus (Ps 111:9; 4Q365 6aii+6c:6). This suggests that it means ‘(the action or power) of
redemption’. Isa 50:2, part of a ‘trial speech’ (Westermann 1969:224), seems to confirm this by God’s speech in a confrontation with Israel, in response to an accusation that he has abandoned them. The
parallel with <span dir="rtl">כח להציל</span> seems to reflect the idea of <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> being
‘strength to deliver’. The same idiomatic use of <span dir="rtl">קצר</span> with <span dir="rtl">יד</span> for
powerlessness is found in Isa 59:1, this time with <span dir="rtl">ישׁע</span> <i>hiph</i>. (These may
both be an allusion to the Exodus; cf. Num 11:23 and Neh 1:10). In contrast to the noun <span dir="rtl">גְּאֻלָה</span>, which emphasizes the kin-relational aspect of the verb <span dir="rtl">גאל</span>, <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span>, ‘action or power of redemption’, highlights the importance of the action of redemption in the verb <span dir="rtl">פדה</span>.   
At Qumran the future hope of redemption implied in Isa 50:2 is developed further, especially in the War Scroll, into a concept of ‘eternal redemption’ (<span dir="rtl">פדות עולמים</span>). The Qumran texts also, however, innovate in employing the noun <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> in a number of combinations (see
<a href="#SynA3">Syntagmatics A.3</a>) to define God’s people as an already ‘redeemed’ people. In one case (1QM 14:10 = 4Q491 8-10 i:8) <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span> alone is used to mean ‘the redeemed community’.

## 7. Conclusion

The noun <span dir="rtl">פְּדוּת</span>, which is used much more frequently at Qumran than in the HB, means ‘(action or power of) redemption’ and always refers to divine activity. It is never used in a cultic or socio-legal context, and unlike <span dir="rtl">פדוים</span> and  <span dir="rtl">פדיון</span> it is never associated with a ‘price’ or ‘payment’. Its main connotations, in addition to liberation, are powerful action and the context of an exclusive relationship (but not a kin relationship). If <span dir="rtl">פְדֻת</span> in Exod 8:19 is an example (see above
<a href="#TDA1">Text Doubtful A.1</a>, it might be explained by a semantic development parallel
to that attested in the case of <span dir="rtl">פרק</span> (see <a href="/sahd/words/to_pull_away/#1-root-and-comparative-material"><span dir="rtl">פָּרַק</span>: Root and Comparative Material</a>).
