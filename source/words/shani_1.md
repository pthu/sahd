##Conclusion

<span dir="rtl" lang="he">שָׁנִי</span> is a ‘bright red dye’ taken from ‘the nests of a scale insect that lives on the Israelian oak (<i>Quercus calliprinos</i> Webb)’ (Keel 1994: 143). This lexeme is highly referential for the ‘bright red, scarlet’ colour produced by this dye. Thus it has limited syntagmatic uses. <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שָׁנִי</span> is often restricted by the term <span dir="rtl" lang="he">תּוֹלֵעָה</span>, ‘worm’, the source of this dye. It is similar in colour to 
<a href="/words/karmil"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">כַּרְמִיל</span></a>, 
for it appears that the latter lexeme is substituted for <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שָׁנִי</span> in the description of the building of Solomon’s temple in 2 Chron. In addition to being produced from a different dye, fabrics dyed <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שָׁנִי</span> had a higher value. The value of these fabrics was just below those dyed blue purple 
<a href="/words/thkeleth"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּכֵלֶת</span></a>
or red purple 
<a href="/words/2argaman"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">אַרְגָּמָן</span></a>. Most Israelites would have been able to readily distinguish these four colours. By contrast <span dir="rtl" lang="he">שָׁנִי</span> is well attested in EBH and only slightly attested in LBH, depending on the dates of the sources in which it occurs in the Pentateuch, and poorly attested in Rabbinic Hebrew.
