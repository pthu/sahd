### Text Doubtful

<b>A.1</b>  For 4Q216 5:7 scholars have suggested a reconstruction based on Jub 2:1-4. The text mentions all the natural phenomena created by God. 4Q222 fr3:2 reflects Jub 48:5, the passage lists the ten plagues sent on Egypt by God (DJD XIII).

<b>A.2</b>  4Q186 fr2 ii:3 presents the word <span dir="rtl">גולש</span>. Probably the word is written
in reverse order in accordance with the rest of the manuscript. So DJD V:91 suggest reading <span dir="rtl">שלוג</span> and that it is probably connected to <span dir="rtl">שלג</span>, ‘snow’, indicating the fairness of the skin. According to Popovic (2006:59) it is impossible to decide from the context whether the word should be read ‘non-coded’ or reversed. 

<b>A.3</b>  In Ps 68:15 the denominative verb <span dir="rtl">שׁלג</span>, ‘to snow’ is applied: <span dir="rtl">תַּשְׁלֵג בְּצַלְמוֹן</span>, ‘it is snowing in Zalmon’. Because it concerns a verb, this passage is not taken into consideration for the analysis.

<b>B.1</b>  There are different theories for the meaning of  <span dir="rtl">שָׁלֶג</span> in Job 9:30. The dictionaries show two interpretations:[^2] ‘snow’ and ‘soap’, assuming that  <span dir="rtl">שׁלג</span> is equivalent to Akk. <i>ašlāku</i>, Mishnaic <span dir="rtl">אֶשְׁלָג</span> and Talmudic  <span dir="rtl">שַׁלְגָּא</span>, ‘soap, soapwort’, from the name of plant whose roots are used as a soap.   
The ancient translations interpreted <span dir="rtl">שׁלג</span> as ‘snow’: LXX: χιον, ‘snow’; Tg: 
<span dir="rtl">במי תלגא</span>, ‘with snow water’; Pesh:
<span dir="rtl">ܒܡ̈ܝܐ ܕܬܠܓܐ</span>, ‘with snow water’; 
Vg: <i>quasi acquis nivis</i>, ‘like snow water’. Since the word *<span dir="rtl">אשׁלג</span> is not attested in BHeb, the interpretation as ‘snow’ seems more meaningful, especially because other passages show the equivalence between snow and purity, as in Job 9:30 (Isa 1:18; Ps 51:9; Lam 4:7). Moreover, the assumption that Akk. <i>ašlāku</i> and Aram. <i>ašlag</i> are related is doubtful, because there is no shift from Akk. <i>k</i> to Aramaic <i>g</i>: Akk. <i>k</i> remains in Aram. as <i>k</i> (Weninger 2011:55).

Qere/Ketiv: none.

## 1. Root and Comparative Material

<b>A.1</b>  Zorell suggests a common Semitic root: <i>šlg</i>. Fronzaroli (1965:140) and Kogan (2011:194) present \*<i>ṯalg</i> as Proto-Semitic root. The latter is better because PS consonant *<i>ṯ</i> shifts into Akkadian and Hebrew <i>š</i> and Aramaic <i>t</i>; instead, PS consonant <i>š</i> is kept in Akkadian, Hebrew, and Aramaic and if we assume <i>šlg</i> as common Proto Semitic root, it wouldn’t explain the Aramaic <i>tlg</i>.

<b>A.2</b>  <i>Akkadian</i>: The Akkadian cognate <i>šalgu(m)</i> means ‘snow’ (<i>AHw</i> iii:1147b; Assyrian: <i>šalgu</i>, ‘snow, sleet’; Old Babylonian, Mari, Standard Babylonian: <i>salku</i> (<i>CAD</i> 
Š<sup><small>I</small></sup>, 241). According to <i>CAD</i> Š<sup><small>I</small></sup>, 242, the word <i>šalgu</i> occurs together with rain in a text from Mari and with ice in a text from Babylon.

<b>A.3</b>  <i>Ugaritic</i>: most dictionaries accept <i>glṯ</i> as the Ugaritic cognate for <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span>, assuming a metathesis from <i>ṯlg</i> to <i>glṯ</i>.[^ug] 
However, the meaning of <i>glṯ</i> is debated: possible translations are ‘storm’; ‘downpour’, and ‘snow’.[^3] 
Aartun (1968:281) suggests that the reading ‘snow’ for <i>glṯ</i> in KTU 1.4.v:6-7 is preferable because of the parallelism with <i>mṭrh</i>, ‘rain’; these two terms, in fact, are related in Hebrew as well (Prov 26:1; Job 37:6).
In addition, the word <i>glṯ</i> appears also in KTU 1.3(+1.8).vi:13-14; 1.92.5; 1.101.7-8.

[^ug]: See, e.g., <i>HALOT</i>, 1503.

<b>A.4</b>  <i>Aramaic</i>: The word is attested in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, and Samaritan Aramaic as  <span dir="rtl">תלג</span>, ‘snow’ (Sokoloff, <i>DJPA</i>, 581); the vocalized form is <span dir="rtl">תְּלַג</span> (Jastrow, <i>DTT</i>, 1670; <i>HALOT</i>, 2006). 
In Syriac is found ܬܠܓܐ (<i>talgā</i>),‘snow’ (Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 1647) and in Mandaic <i>talga</i>, ‘snow’ (MdD 478b). 
In the Aramaic texts from Qumran <span dir="rtl">תלג</span>, ‘snow’ is found in 4Q204 fr1vi:24 and
<span dir="rtl">תלגא</span>, ‘snow’ in 4Q204 fr1 vi:26;  4Q209 fr23:10.

<b>A.5</b>  <i>Phoenician</i>: <span dir="rtl">שׁלג</span> (Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 1412).

<b>A.6</b> <i>Arabic</i>: Hebrew dictionaries present <i>ṯalj</i> as ‘snow’.[^5]

<b>A.7</b> <i>Egyptian</i>: <i>śrg</i> and <i>sá-l-qu</i>, ‘snow’,[^6] <i>sa-ra-qu</i>, ‘snow’(Albright 1974:55).

## 5. Lexical Semantic Field

<b>A.1</b>  Both in the Bible and at Qumran  <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> is often found in parallelism
or close association with other terms of the lexical field of weather:

* <span dir="rtl">כְּפוֹר</span>, ‘hoarfrost’: Ps 147:16;
* <span dir="rtl">קִיטוֹר</span>, ‘fog’: Ps 148:8;
* <span dir="rtl">רוּחַ</span>, ‘wind’: Ps 148:8;
* <span dir="rtl">מָּטָר</span>, ‘rain’: Prov 26:1; Job 37:6;
* <span dir="rtl">גֶשֶׁם</span>, ‘rain’: Isa 55:10; Job 37:6;
* <span dir="rtl">בָּרד</span>, ‘hail’: Ps 148:8; Job 38:22; 4Q381 fr14+5:2; 4Q473 2:6;
* <span dir="rtl">עָנָן</span>, ‘cloud’: Sir 43:15<sup><small>M</small></sup>; 4Q381 fr14+5:2;
* <span dir="rtl">עבים</span>, ‘clouds’: 4Q381 fr14+5:2.

Besides the lexical field of the meteorological phenomena  <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> is
found in close relationship with terms referring to natural phenomena, cleansing and plagues:

* <span dir="rtl">קרח</span>, ‘frost’: Job 6:16; 4Q473 2:6;
* <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>, ‘fire’: Ps 148:8;
* <span dir="rtl">אֵזוֹב</span>, ‘hyssop’: Ps 51:9;
* <span dir="rtl">בֹר</span>, ‘lye’: Job 9:30;
* <span dir="rtl">ירקון</span>, ‘blight’: 4Q473 2:6.


<b>A.2</b>  In many occurrences  <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> is used as a simile (Exod 4:6; Num 12:10; 2 Kings 5:27; Isa 1:18; Prov 26:1; Job 24:19). In Exod 4:6; Num 12:10 and 2 Kings 5:27  <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> is used as a simile for symptoms caused by a skin disease, maybe leprosy (see exegesis for details): the expression is <span dir="rtl">מְצֹרַעַת כַּשָּׁלֶג</span>, ‘leprous (as white) as the snow’.   
In Prov 26:1 ‘snow’ and ‘rain’ are compared with ‘honor’ and in the context are found some antitheses indicating conditions making them unlikely to occur: 
<span dir="rtl">כַּשֶּׁ֤לֶג ׀ בַּקַּ֗יִץ וְכַמָּטָ֥ר בַּקָּצִ֑יר כֵּ֤ן לֹא־נָאוֶ֖ה לִכְסִ֣יל כָּבֽוֹד׃</span>, ‘as snow in summer and as rain in harvest, so honor is not seemly for a fool’. In Job 24:19 the melting snow is compared to the transgressor who is consumed by the netherworld: <span dir="rtl">צִיָּ֤ה גַם־חֹ֗ם יִגְזְל֥וּ מֵֽימֵי־שֶׁ֗לֶג שְׁא֣וֹל חָטָֽאוּ׃</span>, ‘drought and heat consume the snow waters, <i>Sheol</i> those who have committed iniquities’.    
In Sir 43:17 there is a simile
between  <span dir="rtl">שלג</span>, ‘snow’ and <span dir="rtl">רשף</span> ‘flame, flash, plague’: the Masada Scroll reads: <span dir="rtl">כרשף יפרח שלגו</span>,[^MsB]  ‘His snow sprouts forth like a flame’. The meaning of <span dir="rtl">רשף</span> in this context is debated: Askin (2016:38) translates as ‘like sparks his snow scatter’. LXX renders <span dir="rtl">רשף</span> as πετεινὰ, ‘birds’ and Vg as <i>avis</i>, ‘birds’.[^HAL]

[^MsB]: Sir 43:17<sup><small>B</small></sup> has a slightly different reading: <span dir="rtl">[כ]רשף יניף שלגו</span>, ‘his snow sways like a flame’.
[^HAL]: On the meaning of רשף, see <i>HALOT</i>, 1297, <i>s.v.</i> #4, and the literature mentioned there.

<b>A.3</b>  In Mishna and Tosefta the word  <span dir="rtl">שלג</span>, ‘snow’ occurs together with <span dir="rtl">ברד</span>, ‘hail’ (Mishna Mikva’ot 7:1; Mishna Oholot 8:5; Tosefta Oholot 14:6). According to the context it is clear that ‘snow’ here is intended as a natural phenomenon. In Mishna Mikva’ot 7:1 <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> and <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span> are mentioned among materials that can raise the mikveh up to the right quantity and do not make it invalid.

## 6. Exegesis

<b>A.1</b>  Based on the context where the word appears and the meaning of the cognates, the interpretation of <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span>, ‘snow’ is certain.

<b>A.2</b>  In Jer 18:14 the snow is a natural phenomenon, as we can assume from the context. The meaning of the passage is debated, however. The text reads: 
<span dir="rtl">הֲיַעֲזֹב ‏ מִצּוּר ‏ שָׂדַי ‏ שֶׁלֶג לְבָנוֹן</span>, 
‘Can it leave the mountain highland the snow of Lebanon?’ (translation Lundbom 1999:818).   
McKane (2014:428) suggests translating as ‘does the snow ever disappear from the rocky slopes of Lebanon?’; he supposed a shift of  <span dir="rtl">לְבָנוֹן</span> as <i>nomen rectum</i> of  <span dir="rtl">מִצּוּר שָׂדַי</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span>. 
Iwry (1952:164) and Albright (1950:23) compared this passage with Ps 68:15 (in which we have the verb <span dir="rtl">שׁלג</span>, ‘to snow’) and suggest as translation ‘will flints forsake the fields or snow Lebanon?’,[^14] because according
to Albright in the ancient Israel pieces of flint were spread in the fields on the plains. According to Ehrlich (1914:289) and Barbiero (2002:378) the ‘snow of Lebanon’ is ice cold water that flows from Mount Hermon, in Lebanon, down into the valley. Martin Noth (1956:26, 52) refers to one of the names of Hermon used nowadays, viz. ‘<i>dschebel et-teldsch</i>’, ‘Schneeberg’ (‘snow mountain’), because its top is covered over a long period with snow. This supports the rendering by Lundbom, who defended the rendering above on the structure of the two parallel rhetorical questions (Lundbom 1998:821–22).

<b>A.3</b> In ancient Israel the snow is unusual but is known as a meteorological phenomenon. Because of its identity as an extraordinary phenomenon the snow is often mentioned in similes and images. Only two passages refer to snow as a real occurence, <i>viz</i>. 2&nbsp;Sam 23:20/ 1&nbsp;Chron 11:22: 
<span dir="rtl">בְּיוֹם הַשָּׁלֶג</span>, ‘on a snowy day’. It is probably used to refer to a specific timeframe, a locution meaning ‘winter’. Sometimes the term is found in metaphoric context. In Prov 25:13 
<span dir="rtl">כְּצִנַּת־שֶׁלֶג בְּיוֹם קָצִיר צִיר נֶאֱמָן לְשֹׁלְחָיו</span> ‘like the cold of snow in time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger for the one who sent him’. It is quite obvious that the presence of snow in time of summer harvest (May and June) in Israel is unusual. Also, in Prov 26:1 we read about snow in summer 
<span dir="rtl">כַּשֶּׁלֶג בַּקַּיִץ וְכַמָּטָר בַּקָּצִיר כֵּן לֹא־נָאוֶה לִכְסִיל כָּבוֹד׃</span> ‘like snow in summer and rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool’. It is clear that the text is talking about something which is  meteorologically impossible (Fox 2009:783, 792). In Job 24:19 there is comparison between the effects of heat on snow and the effects of Sheol on sinners.

<b>A.4</b>  In a number of passages (Exod 4:6; Num 12:10; 2&nbsp;Kgs 5:27) we find <span dir="rtl">מְצֹרַעַת</span>/ span dir="rtl">מְצֹרָע</span>, pual part. (< <span dir="rtl">צרע</span>) followed by <span dir="rtl">כַּשָּֽֽׁלֶג</span>, ‘as snow’. According to Propp (1998:209), Houtman (1993:395) and Levine (1993:332) the customary rendering ‘leprous’ and ‘leprosy’ (already found in LXX λεπράω in Num 12:10; 2&nbsp;Kgs 5:27) are inaccurate, and <span dir="rtl">צָרַ֤עַת</span> should be considered a generic term for
skin diseases, which manifest themselves with symptoms, like
desquamation resembling the flakiness of snow. 

<b>A.5</b>  Job 38:22 mentions <span dir="rtl">אֹצְרוֹת שָׁ֑לֶג</span>, 
‘storehouses of snow’. As early as in the Ugaritic period the supposition that snow is stored in warehouses is attested (KTU I.4.VII:59).[^15] As Korpel (1990:299, 302) shows, Baal as well as YHWH are said to store, among others, snow in the heavens. Next to the parallel reference to <span dir="rtl">אֹצְרוֹת בָּרָד</span>, ‘storehouses of hail’ in Job 38:22, there are references to a <span dir="rtl">אוֹצָר</span>, ‘storehouse’ for <span dir="rtl">מָטָר</span>, ‘rain’ (Deut 28:12) and for <span dir="rtl">רוּחַ</span>, ‘wind’ (Jer 10:16; 51:16; Ps 135:7).[^store]

[^store]: Korpel (1990:302, n. 662) refers addiitionally to Ps 33:7, where the <span dir="rtl">תְּהוֹמֽוֹת</span>,
‘deeps’ are put in storehouses. 

<b>A.6</b>  In the Qumran texts snow appears in context with other natural phenomena, like  <span dir="rtl">עננים</span>, ‘clouds’,  <span dir="rtl">עבים</span>, ‘clouds’ and  <span dir="rtl">בָּרד</span>, ‘hail’ in 4Q381 fr14+5:2 and <span dir="rtl">קרח</span>, ‘ice’ and  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span>, ‘hail’ in 4Q473 2:6.   
4Q381 is a collection of Psalms and, specifically 4Q381 fr14+5 is connected with creation psalm in 4Q381 fr1. Both fragments refer to natural phenomena and this is the reason why they are probably connected. 
4Q381 fr1 is a creation psalm and since 4Q381 fr14+5 seems to connect to 4Q381 fr1, because of the reference to natural phenomena, it is probably that also 4Q381 fr14+5 is part of this creation psalm (DJD XI:92).  
4Q473 is a parabiblical composition written in a biblical style, that remind to Deuteronomy 28 because of the theme of the two ways, a recurring theme in the Old Testament and in the later Jewish and Christian texts.  
In 4Q473 2:6 the term  <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> is coordinate with  <span dir="rtl">ירקון</span> ‘blight’,  <span dir="rtl">קרח</span>, ‘ice’ and  <span dir="rtl">ברד</span>, ‘hail’. In this context the snow and the other meteorological phenomena are listed as plagues, perhaps retribution from God to people who are not following his way. This composition recalls a
Deuteronomic model for warning, cursing, and blessing, even if it shows innovation compared with the biblical text: mention of angels listing of snow and ice among plagues, like in post biblical tradition (Sir 43:17).[^16] In Sir 43:17, in fact, snow is a plague and appears in the same context with locusts.


<b>A.7</b> In Isa 55:10 <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> occurs together with  <span dir="rtl">גֶשֶׁם</span> ‘rain’ and the two terms are coordinate. In this context the snow and the rain are natural phenomena, and they make the soil bud and sprout, bringing life on the earth. In this passage the benevolent nature of both snow and both rain is clearly and explicitly stated. In two passages <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> occurs in the same context of  <span dir="rtl">מָּטָר</span>, ‘rain’ (Prov 26:1; Job 37:6). The parallel between <i>mṭr</i> and <i>šlg</i> also occurs in KTU 1.4.v:6-7  from Ugarit, as explained in roots.  
In the mythological and epic texts from Ugarit the deity  <i>Baʽal</i>/ <i>Haddu</i> (these two terms are often found in parallelism) is mentioned. From the inscription on the statue of Idrimi from Alalakh, he is called ‘the Storm God’. In the Ug. myths he strives to build his own grand palace on the heights of Mount Saphon (nowadays Jebel Aqra). The myth narrates that when he is dead for seven years the land suffers from the lack of rain, and the former prosperous state is restored only after he returned to life.[^17]

<b>A.8</b>  In a number of cases,  <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> appears in contexts of theophany (Pss 147:16; 148:8; Job 37:6; Job 38:22; Sir 43:17). God
manifests himself and his power trough natural and meteorological phenomena. Depending on context the snow appears with <span dir="rtl">כְּפוֹר</span>, ‘hoarfrost’ (Ps 147:16); <span dir="rtl">אֵשׁ</span>, ‘fire’ (Ps 148:8); <span dir="rtl">רשף</span>, ‘flame, flash’ (Sir 43:17); <span dir="rtl">בָּרָד</span>, ‘hail’
(Ps 148:8; Job 38:22); <span dir="rtl">קִיטוֹר</span>, ‘fog’ (Ps 148:8); <span dir="rtl">גֶשֶׁם מָטָר</span>, ‘downpour of rain’ (Job 37:6).


<b>A.9</b> <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> is used as comparative term for purity in Lam 4:7 <span dir="rtl">זַכּוּ נְזִירֶיהָ מִשֶּׁלֶג צַחוּ מֵחָלָב</span>, ‘her nobles[^18] were purer than snow, more lustrous than milk.’ In Isa 1:18 the snow is a similitude for
the purification of iniquities  <span dir="rtl">אִם יִהְיוּ חֲטָאֵיכֶם כַּשָּׁנִים כַּשֶּׁלֶג יַלְבִּינוּ</span>, ‘even if your iniquities be as scarlet, they
shall be as white as snow’. 
Ps 51:9 also  <span dir="rtl">תְּחַטְּאֵ֣נִי בְאֵז֣וֹב וְאֶטְהָ֑ר תְּ֝כַבְּסֵ֗נִי וּמִשֶּׁ֥לֶג אַלְבִּֽין</span>,  ‘purge me with hyssop and I’ll be purified, wash me with snow and I’ll be whiter than snow’. The term hyssop is found in context related to cleansing and purification. The whiteness is a symbolism for forgiveness (Dalglish 1962:136)

## 7. Conclusion

<b>A.1</b> Mainly <span dir="rtl">שֶׁלֶג</span> is intended as a natural phenomenon and the terms is often used as a similitude. Since the term is used both for positive comparison (purity) both for negative (skin disease) it stands to reason that the term itself is neutral and it takes on a different meaning based on the context.

<b>A.2</b>  The lexeme mainly occurs in Early Biblical Hebrew and from the contexts it is clear that the snow is a natural phenomenon. We have no occurrences in which the snow is intended as a godlike phenomenon connected with the divine will. Just in Late Biblical Hebrew and in Ben Sira (Pss 147:16; 148:8; Job 38:22; Sir 43:17) the snow is mentioned with other natural phenomena in the context of a divine theophany (for functional languages and explanations about Early Biblical Hebrew and Late Biblical Hebrew see Zatelli 2004:140-41).

<b>A.3</b>  In conclusion we can say that snow is not directly connected with the divine will, except for late Hebrew, but even in Late Hebrew most of the occurrences show the snow as a natural phenomenon.
