## <span id="RCM">1. Root and Comparative Material</span>

<b>A.1</b> 
<i>Root.</i>
The word <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> seems ‘of uncertain origin’ (<i>CEDHL</i>, 496). A connection with Heb. <span dir="rtl">עיט</span>, a bird of prey, proposed by some (<i>HCHAT</i>, Bd. 2, 120), is unlikely if the basic root of the latter was √<i>ġyẓ</i> (Ges<sup>18</sup>, 953). 
The proposition by Gesenius (<i>TPC</i>, 1001) to derive the word from a non-existant √<span dir="rtl">עטה</span> = √<span dir="rtl">עצה</span>, ‘to be hard, rigid’, is unacceptable.
The case that the word derives from the Egyptian <i>ʿṭ</i> is advocated by Quack 2022 who considers it a loanword dated to the 1st millenium BCE, Quack (2022: 88).



<b>A.2</b>
<i>Akkadian.</i>
According to some authorities the Akkadian <i>ḫaṭṭu</i>, ‘staff, scepter’, might be a cognate noun (cf. GB, 579, Ges<sup>18</sup>, 950). The <i>ḫ</i> is attested in other Semitic languages as well (<i>CEDHL</i>, 213), cf. <i>\*ḫuṭ</i>, ‘dig, “make signs on the ground”, supported by the Akkadian <i>ḫaṭātu</i>, and several (South-)Arabic languages (<i>HSED</i>, 302); the word is according to Orel and Stolbova also connected with <i>*ḫaṭ</i> – ‘dig’ (<i>HSED</i>, 294).



<b>A.3</b> 
<i>Ugaritic.</i>
Whether or not Ug. <i>ʿṭ</i> — a fish, mollusc or bird — is a cognate cannot be established as long as the precise meaning of this term is unknown (<i>DULAT</i><sup>3</sup>, 189; Watson 2006: 453).


<b>A.4</b> 
<i>Jewish Aramaic.</i>
The cognate <span dir="rtl">עֵיטָא</span> listed in some dictionaries is simply the untranslated word in the Targum on Jer 17:1 (see <a href="#AVa6">Ancient Versions, A.6</a>).


<b>A.5</b> 
<i>Classical Arabic.</i>
Most likely cognates are <i>ġāṭa</i> (√<i>ġwṭ</i>, ‘to dig, hollow out’; <i>ġāṭ</i>, ‘hollow, cavity, pit’; Lane, 2309); see also Syr. Arab. <i>ġawīṭ</i> ‘deep’ (Barthélemy, 587) and some related verbs in Chadic dialects (<i>HSED</i>, 230, 294).



## <span id="FC">2. Formal Characteristics</span>



<b>A.1</b>
The word’s root is either bi- or triconsonantal (<i>*qil</i> < <i>qal</i> or <i>*qil</i> < <i>qal</i> or <i>*qitl</i> < <i>qatl</i>), in BHeb. it is unanimously spelled and vocalised as <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span>. 



## <span id="Syn">3. Syntagmatics</span>



<b>A.1</b>
In BHeb. <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is only found in sg.



<b>A.2</b> <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> occurs as <i>nomen regens</i> of
<span dir="rtl">שֶׁקֶר</span>, ‘lie’ (Jer 8:8),
<span dir="rtl">בַּרְזֶל</span>, ‘iron’ (Jer 17:1; Job 19:24),
<span dir="rtl">עֹפֶרֶת</span>, ‘lead’ (Job 19:24), and
<span dir="rtl">סֹופֵר</span>, ‘scribe’ (Ps 45:2).


<b>A.3</b> <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is subject of
<span dir="rtl">עשׂה</span> <i>qal</i>, ‘to do’, Jer 8:8.


<b>A.4</b> <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is preceded by the preposition
<span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> in Jer 17:1 and Job 19:24. In these cases, the preposition
<span dir="rtl">בְּ</span> introduces the instrument with which the action is performed; 
<span dir="rtl">כתב</span> <i>qal</i> part pass, ‘written’, in Jer 17:1;
<span dir="rtl">חצב</span> <i>niph.</i>, ‘to be hewn’, in Job 19:24.


<b>A.5</b> <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is used in a nominal clause in Ps 45:2:
<span dir="rtl">לְשֹׁונִי עֵט סֹופֵר מָהִיר</span>, ‘my tongue is the stylus of a skilled scribe’.

<b>A.1</b> 
The rendering of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> in Jer 8:8 εἰς μάτην ἐγενήθη σχοῖνος ψευδὴς γραμματεῦσιν, ‘a false pen has become of no use to scribes’ (LSJ, 1084, 349-50, 1747, 2020, 358-59), does not literally correspond to the Hebr. <span dir="rtl">הִנֵּה לַשֶּׁקֶר עָשָׂה עֵט שֶׁקֶר סֹפְרִים</span>, ‘the untruthful pen of the scribes has made it into a lie’. Possibly the translator read <span dir="rtl">חנם</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">הנה</span>. Apparently σχοῖνος  is taken as a reed-pen here. The same interpretation underlies Aquila’s rendering εἰς ἄδικον ἐποίησεν γραφεῖοv ἀδικία γραμματέων. κατῄσχυναν σοφοί,  ‘an unjust stylus caused the injustice of scribes, they will overpower sages’ (LSJ, 23, 1427-29, 359, 23, 359, 928, 1622). 



<b>A.2</b>
Jer 17:1 is missing in <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span>, some unspecified hexaplaric manuscripts however have γραφεῖον (Field<sup>II</sup>, 616 n. 1). The Syro-Hexapla has <span dir="rtl">ܦܪܙܠܐ</span> (<i>parzlā</i>), ‘iron (tool)’ (Payne Smith, <i>TS</i>, 3253;  Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 1235), and in the margin of the text <span dir="rtl">ܓܪܘܦܝܐ</span> (<i>grwpyā</i>), ‘probe, stylus’ (Payne Smith, <i>TS</i>, 787-88;  Sokoloff, <i>SLB</i>, 258-59), which is a loanword (γραφεῖον).



<b>A.3</b>
In Job 19:24 <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">lxx</span> has γραφεῖον, though the whole relevant passage is put between hexaplaric symbols: T? translates the word as πλάξ  or its equivalent πυξίον.



<b>A.4</b> 
<span dir="rtl">ܩܢܝܐ</span> might mean ‘reed (pen)’, but according to Payne Smith, <i>TS</i>, 3654, also ‘stilus’ (Job 19:24). If so, an iron writing tool was apparently acceptable to these translators.



<b>A.5</b> 
For Jer 8:8, the Targum uses a Greek loanword which corresponds to κάλαμος. In Jer 17:1 the Targumist simply took over <span dir="rtl">עיט</span>, even though he normally opted for a consistent rendering within the same book. Possibly he deemed an iron reed-pen an unlikely combination. 
Job 19:24 is not preserved in 11Q10 (11QTgJob). The rabbinic Targum of Job offers <span dir="rtl">קלמז</span> (var. <span dir="rtl">כלמסע</span>), again the Greek loanword κάλαμος.



<span id="AVa6"><b>A.6</b></span>
Vg always renders <i>stilus</i> or <i>stylus</i> which is ‘used by the Romans for writing on waxen tablets (pointed and usually made of iron)’ (Lewis & Short, <i>LD</i>, 1759).



## <span id="LSF">5. Lexical/Semantic Fields</span>


<b>A.1</b> 
The word is used for a writing instrument which can be used on various recepticals and in some instances it said explicitly to be made of iron (Jer 17:1, Job 19:24). Cf. Jer 17:1 where the word is related to <span dir="rtl">צִפֹּ֣רֶן</span>. It is used as an instrument to ‘write’ (Jer 17:7) or ‘make (engravings)’ (as implied in Job 19:24 and Jer 8:8). 



## <span id="Exe">6. Exegesis</span>

### <span id="Exe-lit">6.1 Textual Evidence</span>



<b>A.1</b>
<span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is found rendered as ‘stylus’ and is found as the first-given rendering in: BDB, 741: ‘1. Stylus’; <i>DBHE</i>, 531: ‘Punzón de escribir, estilo’; GB, 579: ‘v. eisernen Griffel’; Ges<sup>18</sup>, 950: ‘Griffel, aus Eisen’; <i>HAL</i>, 769: ‘Griffel’; <i>HAWAT</i>, ‘Griffel zum Einritzen’; <i>HWAT</i>, 502: ‘der Griffel’; Zorell, 588: ‘stylus ferreus, quo litterae metallo vel lapidi inciduntur’; <i>MHH</i>, 791: ‘<span dir="rtl">חרט עשוי ברזל</span>’ <i>NIDOTTE</i>, vol. 4, 1291: ‘pen, stylus’.

In second instance the rendering of ‘reed-pen’ or the like is offered by: BDB, 741: ‘... 2. prob. = reed-pen’; <i>DBHE</i>, 531: ‘pluma, cálamo’; GB, 579: ‘... wahrsch. auch v. calamus Jer 8:8. Ps 45:2’; Ges<sup>18</sup>, 950: ‘... Schreibrohr’; (<i>HAL</i>, 769: ‘... u. ? Schreibrohr’); (<i>HAWAT</i>, ‘... oder Schreiben übhpt.’); (<i>HWAT</i>, 502: ‘... v. Schreibrohr: ... Ps 45,2 ... Jer 8,8’; Zorell, 588: ‘... calamus (iunceus) scribae Jr 8 8’; <i>NIDOTTE</i>, vol. 4, 1291: ‘pen, ...’. 

The rendering of <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> as ‘stylus’ is the only explanation given by: <i>HCHAT</i>, Bd. 2, 133 is: ‘eig. das Eingrabende, der (eiserne) Griffel, stilus’; KBL, 697: ‘Griffel stylus’, Gesenius, <i>TPC</i>, 1001: ‘stilus’.

The rendering of the word as ‘stylus’ is questioned by Zhakevich who proposes the more neutral ‘writing instrument’ based on the fact that the determinator <span dir="rtl">בַּרְזֶל</span> or <span dir="rtl">סֹופֵר</span> seems it indicate either a reed/rush pen or an engraving tool (Zhakevich 2020: 124, n. 1).



<b>A.2</b>
In Jer 8:8 the word refers to the untruthful writing instrument of scribes (<span dir="rtl">עֵט שֶׁקֶר סֹפְרִים</span>), the result of which is a law that is not in accordance with the Law of God. Thus, because of the addition of the adjective untruthful (<span dir="rtl">שֶׁקֶר</span>) to <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span>, one cannot exclude the possibility that <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> itself too has a figurative meaning here. In any case the text does not state clearly on which material these scribes were supposed to be writing. Was it a 
→ <span dir="rtl">סֵפֶר</span>? Or a public proclamation on a → <span dir="rtl">לוּחַ</span>, ‘tablet’, like the Mosaic ‘tablets of stone’?

In Jer 17:1 the word refers to an ‘iron graver’ with which the sins of Judeans had been written on the tablet (<span dir="rtl">לוּחַ</span>) of their hearts and on the horns of their altars. On the one hand this passage is to be taken as a witness for the literal use of the word, on the other hand one cannot neglect that the whole verse has a figurative meaning. Since the horns of an altar were of natural stone or metal, the iron <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> can only be a stylus or graver here. The use of a term for an engraving tool suggests that their sinful hearts were like stone (cf. Ezek 11:19; 36:26). Because it is used in parallelism with → <span dir="rtl">צִפֹּרֶן</span>, another type of graver, the stylus may have had a hardened tip.

A clear case of the literal use of <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is Job 19:24. In this case it means the iron stylus or graver with which a scribe (or Job himself) carves Job’s words as characters in the hard and solid surface of a rock (<span dir="rtl">בַּצּוּר יֵחָצְבוּן</span>). The meaning of <span dir="rtl">וְעֹפָרֶת</span>, ‘and lead’, in this verse is unclear. Some scholars suppose that it refers to incising characters into a plaque of lead, others think of lead or lead oxide used to fill in the incised characters (cf. Clines 1989: 456-57). 

Thus in all three cases the <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> may be understood as an instrument with which scribes incised text into metal or stone. It seems improbable that based on Jer 8:8 and Ps 45:2 (for which see <a href="#Exe-fig">Figurative Use</a>) a reed-pen or the like was meant.



### <span id="Exe-fig">6.2 Figurative Use</span>


<b>A.1</b>
In some of the afore-mentioned instances <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is used in an ambiguous way and it is a matter of debate whether it is used in a figurative way. In Psalm 45:2 [1], however, the figurative use of <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> seems beyond doubt, because in this case the tongue clearly functions as a ‘stylus’. In this case too the writing material is not specified, but a king’s heroic deeds were usually recorded on non-perishable stone or metal surfaces, because they had to be remembered ‘for ever and ever’ (cf. Ps 45:17). The circumstance that the owner is described as a <span dir="rtl">סֹופֵר מָהִיר</span> is not an argument in favour of a reed-pen, because this expression merely designates ‘a skilled scribe’ (cf. Ezra 7:6).

This designation is evaluated in Schniedewind 2019: 133, and he leans more towards the suggestion put forward by Anson of considering the term <span dir="rtl">סֹופֵר מָהִיר</span> in Ps 45:2 and Ezra 7:6 as a possible equivalent of the Egyptian term for a military scribe <i>sš mhr</i> (Schniedewind 2019: 40-41, 131-33). However the explanation of the expression <span dir="rtl">סֹופֵר מָהִיר</span> especially in Ps 45:2 [1]  being a calque of this Egyptian term is to be denounced following Mulder 1972: 97-98, who holds that the phrase 
<span dir="rtl">סֹופֵר מָהִיר</span> corresponds to a set phrase in Akkadian: <i>ṭupšarru emqu</i>; in this line the phrase <span dir="rtl">דָּבָר טֹוב</span> (Ps 45:2a) is also reflecting on Neo-Assyrian court literature (Mulder 1972: 95-98). Mulder holds the position that Psalm 45 displays a huge influence of the court style of the Neo-Assyrian empire and is directly or indirectly dependant on Akkadian literature (Mulder 1972: 148-58).



<b>A.2</b>
In 44Q171 fr3-10.iv:26-27, Ps 45:2 is quoted and applied to the Teacher of Righteousness.



<b>B.1</b>
In the Bomberg Bible the following addition to Jer 17:1 <span dir="rtl">דְבַרזַל</span> is found: <span dir="rtl">אגוריהו ואשירהו</span>, ‘of a good and robust quality’. But in <i>BiA</i>, vol. 2, 176, the editor points to the fact that it is in fact a misplacement of these words, which  must have occured in the printing process of this bible.



<b>B.2</b>
The figurative aspect of the adjective <span dir="rtl">דְבַרזַל</span> might be underlined by the use of the adjective ‘gold’ to refer to a divine stylus in the Testament of Abraham Rec. B 10, referred to by M. Bar-Ilan 1988: 27.



### <span id="Exe-ico">6.3 Pictorial Material</span>


<b>A.1</b>
Although there is linguistic evidence that a <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> is an instrument to incise characters into a hard surface, there is no (pictorial) evidence for these tools in Israelite archeology or art (cf. Niditch 1996: 71 n. 63).



### <span id="Exe-ar">6.4 Archaeology</span>


<b>A.1</b>
[Will be added later]


## <span id="Con">7. Conclusion</span>





<b>A.1</b>
The context, the Arabic cognates, and some of the ancient versions point in the direction of an iron tool (graver, stylus) with which characters were incised into a hard surface (rock, metal). The ancient versions which understood the word as a reed-pen interpreted it after the most common scribal tool of their own times. However, none of the four passages in which <span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> occurs suggests the use of ink and a reed-pen. At least once the word is clearly attested in a figurative use (Ps. 45:2 [1]).
<span dir="rtl">עֵט</span> belongs to the small category of technical terms (→ <span dir="rtl">חֶרֶט</span>, 
→ <span dir="rtl">צִפֹּרֶן</span>, → <span dir="rtl">קֶסֶת</span>, → <span dir="rtl">שֶׂרֶד</span>, 
→ <span dir="rtl">מְּחוּגָה</span>), the basic function of which is either the essential shaping of artefacts or the writing of characters.
