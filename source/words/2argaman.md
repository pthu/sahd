According to an inscription of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (RINAP 3/1, 4:56), ‘blue-purple wool and red-purple wool’ (SÍG.<i>ta-kil-tú</i> SÍG.<i>ar-ga-man-nu</i>; cf. <a href="/words/thkeleth"/><span dir="rtl" lang="he">תְּכֵלֶת</span></a>) were among the gifts that King Hezekiah of Jerusalem sent to Sennacherib.


##Conclusion

<span dir="rtl" lang="he">אַרְגָּמָן</span>
references ‘bright, rich red purple’. It is a Hitt. loanword (< <i>ark/gamman-</i>, ‘tribute’) that entered Heb. probably from a Canaanite language. The dye was obtained from ‘several gasteropoda molluscs such as Murex brandaris, Murex trunculus, Purpura lapillus and Purpura haemastoma’ (Van Soldt 1990: 345-46), which were primarily found along the north-west coast of Palestine. The workers took secretions from the small bladder of the molluscs. The secretion was yellow, but it turned red on exposure to light (Van Soldt 1990: 346). By metonymy <span dir="rtl" lang="he">אַרְגָּמָן</span> stands for ‘fabrics dyed reddish purple’. Garments made out of these fabrics served as symbols of royalty and honour. Thus these fabrics were used to adorn palaces and royal gardens. Such fabrics were used to decorate the shrines of the gods and for clothing the idols. The Israelites used rich, red purple fabrics in the tabernacle and also for a variety of objects used in the service of the tabernacle. For cabins on their boats the Phoenicians made awnings out of purple. In addition, women used purple dye to colour their hair and as a facial cosmetic.
